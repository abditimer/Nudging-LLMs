       "{'podcasts::huberman::how_to_build_immense_inner_strength_David_Goggins': 'David Goggins\\nWelcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman, and I\\'m a professor\\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins.\\nDavid Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He\\'s also a highly accomplished ultramarathon runner.\\nFor those of you that don\\'t know, ultramarathons are distances longer than 26 miles and, in David\\'s case, often longer\\nthan 200 miles. For his achievements in athletics, he has been inducted into the International Sports\\nHall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours.\\nI should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also graduated from Army Ranger School.\\nDavid is also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled \"Can\\'t Hurt Me\"\\nand the second entitled \"Never Finished,\" both of which are best sellers. David\\'s books cover many topics, including\\nhis autobiographical description of what can only be described as an incredibly challenging child\\nand young adulthood. His home was abusive. His school environment was abusive. He essentially had no positive resources directed his way and.\\nIn his 20s, he found himself to be obese, that is, more than 300 pounds working a job\\nhe despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that David began an inner dialogue\\nthat forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood but also the position that he found himself\\nin as a young man and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the Navy\\nSEAL, the ultramarathon runner, the bestselling author, and the extraordinarily positive and influential man\\nthat he is today. As some of you may know, David has done various public lectures.\\nHe\\'s a familiar face online because there are so many clips of him on YouTube.\\nAnd he has done podcasts before. However, I\\'m certain that you\\'ll find today\\'s discussion to be very different than previous podcasts\\nthat David has been featured on. The reason is that-- of course, we get into his accomplishments.\\nWe talk about the mindset that allowed him to achieve those things. But, today, David really lets us under the hood.\\nHe lets us into the form of inner dialogue that he has to embrace, indeed that he\\nhas to grapple with on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times throughout the day and night in order\\nto impose the sort of self-discipline that he is so well known for. We also get into some of the scientific mechanisms\\nunderlying willpower. And we talk about David\\'s current endeavors that include, for instance, his own exploration of science\\nand medicine for which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner. I should mention that multiple times throughout today\\'s\\ndiscussion you will hear curse words. Now David and I both acknowledge that cursing\\nisn\\'t for everybody and that cursing itself is different than cursing at somebody.\\nNonetheless, we do realize that many people, parents perhaps especially, might not want to hear cursing.\\nIf you don\\'t want to hear cursing, well, then this podcast episode is probably not for you.\\nHowever, if you are comfortable with cursing or if you can tolerate it, I assure you today\\'s discussion is highly worthwhile.\\nSponsors: Maui Nui, AeroPress & Eight Sleep\\nBefore we begin, I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools\\nto the general public. In keeping with that theme, I\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious\\nred meat available. I\\'ve spoken before on this podcast and there\\'s general consensus that most people should strive\\nto consume approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Now when one strives to do that, it\\'s\\nimportant to maximize the quality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio because you don\\'t want to consume an excess of calories\\nwhen trying to get that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein\\nto calorie ratio. So it makes getting that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy.\\nIt\\'s also delicious. Personally, I like the ground venison. I also like the venison steaks. And then for convenience when I\\'m on the road,\\nI like the jerky. The jerky has a very high protein to calorie ratio. So it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick,\\nand it has something like only 55 calories, so, again, making it very easy to get enough protein without consuming excess calories.\\nIf you would like to try Maui Nui Venison, you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off your first order. Again, that\\'s mauinuivenison.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off. Today\\'s episode is also brought to us by AeroPress. AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,\\nbut it is, in fact, a much better way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago.\\nAnd I\\'ve been using one ever since. AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler, who\\nwas an engineer at Stanford. And I knew of Alan because he had also built the so-called Aerobie Frisbee, which I believe\\nat one time, perhaps still now, held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest thrown object.\\nAnd I used to see Alan, believe it or not, at parks around Palo Alto testing out different Aerobie\\nFrisbees. So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering\\nthat turned into commercial products. Now I love coffee. I\\'m somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually\\nabout 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning, although not always. Sometimes if I\\'m going to exercise,\\nI\\'ll drink coffee first thing in the morning. But I love, love, love coffee. And what I\\'ve personally found is that by using the AeroPress,\\nI can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee. I don\\'t know what exactly it is in the AeroPress that\\nallows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared\\nto any other form of brewing that coffee, even the traditional French press. The AeroPress is extremely easy to use.\\nAnd it\\'s extremely compact. In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel. And I use it on the road, in hotels, even on planes.\\nI\\'ll just ask for some hot water, and I\\'ll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane. If you\\'d like to try AeroPress, you can go\\nto aeropress.com/huberman. That\\'s A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcom slash Huberman to get 20% off\\nany aeropress coffeemaker. AeroPress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada, and over 60 other countries around the world.\\nAgain, that\\'s aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today\\'s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.\\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I\\'ve spoken many times before on this podcast\\nabout the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now a key component of getting a great night\\'s sleep\\nis that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\\nAnd in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees.\\nOne of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times, at the beginning\\nand throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up, is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.\\nAnd that\\'s what Eight Sleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall\\nand stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized.\\nI\\'ve been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for almost three years now. And it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.\\nIf you\\'d like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to get $150 off their Pod 3 mattress cover.\\nEight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia.\\nAgain, that\\'s eightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with David Goggins.\\nDavid Goggins, welcome. DAVID GOGGINS: My man. Good to see you again, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great to see you.\\nLearning, Studying & Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\\nIt was late 2016, early 2017, I believe, when you were in my lab at Stanford. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a little work later that day\\ndown in San Jose. And, gosh, see you everywhere, but it\\'s not enough. So great to have you here.\\nThanks for having me on, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You embody discipline and doing hard things.\\nI think we should just start right off with-- DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah. Let\\'s just go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --the bold truth. But right before we went hot mics,\\nwe were talking about learning. Right now, you\\'re spending some time learning and doing things\\nthat I think most people probably don\\'t typically associate David Goggins with. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don\\'t you tell us about that?\\nWell, most people just look at me as the guy that runs and yells as he\\'s running.\\nWhile I do that to motivate people, but people don\\'t understand that my day is broken up\\ninto segments. I work out. I eat. I sleep, but I spend most of my time studying.\\nSo like I\\'m in the medical world. I\\'m a paramedic in Canada. But I spend a lot of my time trying\\nto nuke every single thing about it because I\\'m not trying to just be a paramedic, learn about veins,\\nand arteries, and how the heart pumps, and stuff like that. I\\'m trying to learn to the point where I can save someone\\'s life.\\nAnd even though paramedics are doing that all over the world, I\\'m trying to be that paramedic that can really dissect exactly what\\'s going on and figure out what medication\\ngoes where, just trying to learn the algorithm of what\\'s going on, man.\\nSo I spent a lot of time with it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love the word algorithm because when I teach biology or try and learn\\nanything that\\'s related to biology and especially the human body, I need to know the nouns.\\nBut it\\'s the verbs that matter. And that\\'s really what you\\'re talking about. Just saying that sits there, that brain part there,\\ndoesn\\'t tell you how it all works together. So what does your process for studying look like?\\nIf we dropped a camera in the room, brought a microphone into your inner dialogue--\\ngosh, wouldn\\'t we all love that. But if we dropped a microphone into your inner dialogue, are you waking up looking at the books and going,\\nyeah, fresh day, let\\'s learn or is some of the same resistance that you\\'ve talked about coming up around physical work,\\nis that coming up from time to time? DAVID GOGGINS: You know what, I was nervous at first. I\\'m going to keep it real.\\nI\\'m going to keep it real. So I\\'m not a real smart guy. And what I mean by that is I was born with ADD, ADHD.\\nLike my brain cannot retain information. I\\'m not some genetic freak when it comes to running,\\nwhen it comes to lifting weights. I am absolutely the bottom of the barrel. And people will never believe me.\\nAnd they can just whatever. Believe what you want to believe. So when you ask me this question about what does studying look\\nlike for me, I have to go over the same page over, and over,\\nand over, and over again, while Jennifer can look at that page while she\\'s quizzing me, she\\'ll learn it right then\\nas she\\'s-- she didn\\'t know anything about it. She will quiz herself or quiz me and learn it\\nas she\\'s quizzing me. It\\'s the most frustrating thing in the world how my brain works.\\nSo what I do is I literally sit there with a pen and paper. And I have my books.\\nAnd I go through and have to write everything down every single day.\\nI will study the same page until it\\'s photographic memory from writing the same thing down.\\nAnd then from there, I\\'ll go back through and relearn it again. So I\\'ll learn the bulk of it.\\nBut then I\\'ll go through and learn the small things within that.\\nSo if it\\'s a medication, I\\'ll learn what the medication does. First, I\\'ll learn how to even say\\nthe medication because these medications aren\\'t like albuterol.\\nNo, it\\'s very big words. So I\\'ll go through, learn how to say the name. Then I\\'ll go through learn what the dose is.\\nThen I\\'ll go through-- and this is like every single day. So it\\'s not like, oh, I got it. Let\\'s just go through-- no, nothing is I got it.\\nEvery single thing-- so I can\\'t wait to get in this conversation because everything\\nI do in life, it sucks. Everything I do in life, it sucks.\\nThat\\'s why when I was 300 pounds and 24 years old, it wasn\\'t like I had some big epiphany of let\\'s just\\ngo be a Navy SEAL, and let\\'s lose some weight. No, I knew my entire life was going\\nto be a struggle, which is why I just ignored it. And I said, I\\'m not even trying to jump off any of this shit\\nand learn how to read, how to write, how to memorize, how to become something I am not.\\nBut through that process, something happened to me. And I realized-- this is why I feel sorry for no one.\\nIn this podcast, they\\'re going to really not like me because people are going to think\\nthat I am maybe lying or maybe fibbing or exaggerating.\\nNo, I am literally-- I was the lowest form on Earth, no talent, no ability to learn.\\nAnd I literally know what it is to be rock bottom and to build that up. So that question about learning is the pain in my ass.\\nAnd I don\\'t have to do it. Just think about it. I\\'m 49 years old, and I\\'m a multi-millionaire.\\nI don\\'t have to do anything. So all I thought about when I was growing up is, man, I can\\'t wait to one day get to the point\\nwhere I no longer have to do this stuff. But what happened as I got older, it became a way of living.\\nSo how I do every day is how I do every day. It\\'s a discipline. It\\'s a regimen.\\nIt was a choice I made. And the choice I made was what are you willing to sacrifice,\\nand what are you willing to give up to find every bit of who you are as a human being? And I was willing to give up everything to do that.\\nSo studying is no joke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that you\\'re studying. I recall a few years ago, I heard some interview or podcast\\nwith you. And you just threw out like I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do next. Maybe I\\'ll be a scientist. And I went yeah.\\nBecause I knew-- because I know you a bit. And I see your work out there, but we had met before, that if you decided\\nthat you were going to do it-- and learning medicine, which is what you\\'re doing, learning human physiology is so detailed.\\nVery. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And people out there have to understand when you look at a textbook and you see the veins and the capillaries different colors,\\nwhen the body is open, they\\'re not different colors. DAVID GOGGINS: Right, right, right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I mean, some things have different color contrasts, but it\\'s not\\nlike it\\'s all labeled when you pop it open. DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the process of writing things down\\nWriting & Learning, ADHD & Focus\\nby hand is important for you. So you go back and read those notes. Do you think about that stuff on your runs too or are you segmenting your day\\nlike when you\\'re done studying, are you heading out for a run and thinking about other things? Or are you still rehearsing the material in your head?\\nSo when I write it down, I write it down, and I\\'m able to-- I\\'m actually looking down at this table\\nright now because I\\'m back to writing. So I\\'m actually there right now as I\\'m speaking to you. I write it down in a way that I\\'m memorizing page 69.\\nSo I\\'m writing it down. So then writing it down and that page sync together in my brain.\\nSo I\\'m looking at the book in my brain right now. That\\'s just how it works for me.\\nAnd I have to do it over and over again. So that page is stuck in my mind. So I\\'m literally flipping through pages\\nas I\\'m taking these tests. And I\\'m taking these national tests to become a paramedic or become an advanced EMT or whatever.\\nI\\'m literally as I\\'m taking that test I\\'m going through. And I\\'m like-- now I\\'m flipping pages in my head\\nwhere that page was. And how I do that is just from how I write it and how it\\'s on the page.\\nWhen I run, I can\\'t recall any of it.\\nI cannot bring any of that because I\\'m running. How my mind is wired now is that everything I do is what I do.\\nBecause the focus it takes for me to-- right now, I\\'m running. I\\'m not like a great runner.\\nI\\'m not like injury free. So like my first 20 minutes of the run I\\'m limping.\\nI\\'m literally limping because I\\'ve had several knee surgeries. And my body was twisted.\\nAnd so now it\\'s untwisting. So people look at me, oh, looks, like he\\'s limping when he runs.\\nI am limping when I run. My body is jacked up so I\\'m focusing on how to get the best out of a broken body.\\nSo everything I do is a total focus on what I\\'m doing at that point in my life.\\nSo it seems like you\\'ve really trained away or somehow gotten away from the ADD\\nthat you mentioned because what you described is like a deep trench. It\\'s like a V shaped trench. I\\'m imagining like there\\'s a ball bearing,\\nand it\\'s like, phewp, and it can only go forward in that trench or back. And it goes forward. It\\'s not like sliding around at the concave at the bottom,\\nzip-zip-zip, like a tension. So it\\'s like you trained that up. Is there a similar feeling when you\\'re\\nin the full focus of running versus full focus of studying? Does it kind of feel like, oh yeah,\\nthat\\'s the same groove but different thing or is it just completely different world? DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s a completely different world.\\nBoth of them for me is suffering, but it\\'s suffering a whole different way. Like when I was going through school, I never forget--\\nI think I was in third grade. And back then, ADD, ADHD, wasn\\'t like here\\'s this medicine\\nor here\\'s this thing. They want to put you in a special school. So for me, I was so far behind in learning\\nthat their big thing was let\\'s just put him in a special school because he\\'ll never learn.\\nAnd through that process of like I don\\'t want to be in a special school, I don\\'t want to be treated any differently, it really--\\nlike I never took medication. I\\'ve never taken medication for this. That\\'s why right now you see me looking right in your eyes.\\nWhat the hell is Huberman saying right now. And that\\'s why I don\\'t feel bad for people who have ADHD,\\nwho have learning disabilities. And some are impossible because you just can\\'t.\\nBut a lot of them you can. But people don\\'t want to go through the process of focus,\\nof teaching yourself how to truly focus. This is where my message gets lost. It gets lost because I may say MF or F because that\\'s\\nthe passion that comes out of me. It takes everything for me to learn a sentence.\\nSo when I speak about David Goggins, I can\\'t speak about David Goggins in a way that\\'s just calm and cool.\\nBecause when I wake up, I know the journey that it takes for me to find my greatness. And it\\'s hard.\\nNothing is easy. Nothing just like, oh, I wake up, and I just do this or I do that or it just-- no, I watch people every day\\ngo through life, and it\\'s so easy. For me to be where I\\'m at today, it takes every bit of me.\\nSo when I speak about it, and as I get going here, you\\'ll start seeing me-- the tempo will rise.\\nThe passion will come out because I\\'m back there. I\\'m doing what I do every day to become a human being.\\nAnd so nothing is easy. Like running is running. It sucks. But you have a choice to make.\\nDo you want to sit down and go back to that guy you once were? No. So this is what it takes.\\nIt takes that misunderstanding of people. And they\\'ll never get it because they were never David Goggins.\\nSo that is what it takes for me to do what I do. It may take you something differently. So for me, everything has to be in the study.\\nEverything has to be into this. Everything has to be in-- everywhere I am it has to be there, me, focused where I am.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re my second podcast I\\'ve done since Rogan, since the book came out. I don\\'t have time for that shit because if I want to be great,\\nI\\'m not trying to maximize money or maximize people knowing me. I do these things because maybe someone out there will\\nunderstand me and get it and say, I can grow from this guy, and others just won\\'t.\\nFriction, Focus, “Conqueror’s Mindset”\\nSounds like friction is something you\\'re very familiar with. It\\'s a word just I feel like is like cast above us\\nright now in bold face, highlighted, underlined letters. DAVID GOGGINS: Friction is growth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction, like you\\'re up in the morning.\\nAnd I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee maker, stretching out, good morning, sunshine.\\nAnd you\\'re telling me from eyelids open there\\'s friction. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that is the thing that people\\ndon\\'t-- they don\\'t fucking get. The biggest misunderstanding about David Goggins of all time--\\nit\\'s like whether you believe in God or not-- I do-- he put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet\\nand said let me fucking see what a beat up, abused kid who can barely learn, barely learn,\\nwho has a twisted body, messed up genetics, sickle cell, this and that, let me give him everything\\nthat pretty much disqualifies you from the military. But back then, it wasn\\'t as-- and let\\'s put him in this\\nand see what comes out of it. So to do that, friction-- you don\\'t wake up in the morning time\\nand go to the coffee maker. Matter of fact, sometimes you don\\'t even sleep. What it requires is when I\\'m at--\\n2 o\\'clock-- it\\'s 2 o\\'clock in the morning. And my brain is thinking about a fucking drug.\\nAnd I got to get up and look in my book to see what that drug is, how I remember it.\\nAnd this is every day of my fucking life. That\\'s why when I train a fighter or I train someone,\\nI\\'m like, you have no fucking idea how great you really are because you are using such minimal,\\nminimal of what you have. And if people can learn to focus, this is what\\'s possible.\\nWhile it may not be pretty-- like people want to do a documentary on me. I go no. I don\\'t want to do a documentary on me\\nbecause I will have normal everyday people picking me apart. Oh, his life is miserable.\\nWho wants to live like that? It\\'s crazy how he-- it\\'s almost like he\\'s sick.\\nHe\\'s psychotic. The most frustrating thing in the world for me\\nis when normal people judge a man like myself on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing.\\nIt takes every bit of who you are if you choose that route. If you don\\'t, Merry Christmas, do what you got to do.\\nBut, yeah, all these things for me-- like I told you, man, I\\'m going to keep it real.\\nI\\'m not coming here to talk about perform without purpose\\nbecause I go through-- when I write these books, I go through, I try to dumb down David Goggins.\\nHow can I give normal people-- and I\\'m normal. But I found something that most don\\'t want to find.\\nHow can I speak to people and give them something from this crazy psychotic brain that I\\'ve\\ndeveloped? How can I give them that? So I sit down with Jennifer for years and write down perform without purpose,\\ncallus your mind, armor your mind, the cookie jar, the accountability mirror, shit that people can fucking use\\nin their lives. No, no, I\\'m glad it helps you.\\nBut the barbaric life that I live that you have to live,\\nthe almost obsession that you must have to be great, you can\\'t put that shit in a fucking book, bro.\\nYou can\\'t put in a book. You can\\'t. You can\\'t write about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It has to be experienced. DAVID GOGGINS: It has to be experienced.\\nAnd you can\\'t even-- after you experience it, to write it in the book,\\nit would seem like he needs to be locked up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory. DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s too gory.\\nDoesn\\'t make sense for a guy that everything, every second of the day he is trying\\nto extract more from something. He\\'s constantly thinking. He\\'s constantly, constantly disciplined,\\nnever going off the path. Whatever is injured on him, he figures away. It\\'s a conquerors mindset.\\nAnd very few people, if any, can really understand what that is.\\nLike I\\'m almost 50. And I\\'ve been this way for almost 30 years.\\nLike what do you do for fun? These questions, I don\\'t get them.\\nI don\\'t understand them. I don\\'t-- so yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get asked that sometimes, what do you do for fun. I start listing off all this stuff like podcasting, reading,\\nworking out. So some of that resonates. But I think what\\'s so truly unusual about what\\nEarly Hardships, “Haunted”\\nyou\\'re describing, your process is that from go it\\'s hard.\\nAnd I have to ask was being 300 pounds, having essentially-- I\\'m using the words you\\'ve described.\\nNo, do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You\\'ve said it before. You had a tendency at one point in your life early on tell lies, try and get people\\'s approval.\\nLied my ass off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy haircuts, attention seeking, and yet all of that triggered something\\nthat now is extraordinary. Do you think those hardships were\\nnecessary to flip the switch? DAVID GOGGINS: I don\\'t know if they were necessary, but it was something that made me feel--\\nI didn\\'t feel good. It was easy. The brain that I was given as a child,\\nit was easy to go home and think about, how do I want to be a freak today? How do I want to show up to school today and be a freak?\\nIt didn\\'t require me going home and opening a book up saying, it\\'s going to take me all year to learn this fucking page.\\nSo instead of learning that page, I learned how to become a character.\\nAnd maybe that character that I created, that 300 pound, insecure guy that\\nused to fake it till I make it type of guy, let me become your friend, let me lie to you\\nuntil you like me type of guy-- when you have any manhood, womanhood, a human being,\\na soul, a spirit, any-- I must have just this much pride because that\\'s exactly\\nwhat opened the door for me. Because every day, you were a character. Every day, you were a clown. Every day, you opened that Spanish book or that science\\nbook or English book, and you looked at it. It looked like a foreign language.\\nAnd you\\'re saying, where do I start? Where do I start? And, obviously, it was necessary.\\nThe more I talk about it, it was necessary because what happened is I became haunted by the mere fact\\nthat this is my existence. And you got to live with that. And I lived with it for a lot of years.\\nAnd so I sat back and said, OK, all right, I know what this takes. And when you sit back, as fucked up as I was--\\nand I had a laundry list, a table like this of what I have to do to become\\njust a human being that can make ends meet, that can make $1,000 a month.\\nJust to get there was like, oh my god, dude, like how-- I\\'m 16, 17, I can\\'t read.\\nI can\\'t write. Oh my god, I\\'m so behind the power curve.\\nAnd my brain is about being depressed. And my dad beat-- my mom\\'s not home. And kids are calling me nigger at school.\\nAnd I\\'m like, oh my god, man, what the fuck do I do? And it wasn\\'t like someone came around and said,\\nhey, man, you can do this. This is all me. Some people want to know where does this cold man come from.\\nI\\'m not trying to be cold. It\\'s the reality of my life. It\\'s the reality of a lot of people\\'s lives.\\nAnd so, yeah, that had to happen for me to be haunted, to be haunted, to pull out, to extract\\nthe guy that I am today. That haunting is something that\\'s still there today\\nbecause no matter how much you improve, no matter how much you change who you are,\\nit\\'s not permanent. You don\\'t just wake up and say, oh my god, man,\\nyou\\'re David Goggins. You break records. You do this. You do that. People want to know, how are you able to just be so hard?\\nBecause I never turn the fucking thing off. Because once it turns off, I go right back\\nto the David Goggins that is. And that\\'s the guy that I\\'m constantly fighting every day.\\nAnd it\\'s a choice. And that choice makes you misunderstood. It makes you crazy.\\nThat\\'s why I hate fucking social media. In 2013, people wanted me to write my book.\\nI did it in 2018. Took five years. And the reason why I didn\\'t do it--\\nI sat at the table, and Jennifer was there. This was before she started working for me, I started dating her or whatever.\\nAnd all these people were there. And they\\'re like, man, you got to go on social media. And I was like, fuck you, man.\\nIt\\'s poison. It\\'s poison because I knew what I did to get where I am.\\nAnd I\\'m going to have these people, these normal, everyday people, fat, lazy,\\nexactly who I was judging me. Because I know it because I was once them.\\nAll my hard work, all my dedication, I\\'m going to have some normal dude get his little brownie, his little Ding Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie,\\nsit there with his coffee picking me apart. Oh, he must be unhappy.\\nDo you know how hard it is to put these shoes on every damn morning? And I\\'m gonna have you pick me apart?\\nSo, yeah, there\\'s so much that goes into this\\nthat I was like fuck this. I never wanted anything to do with it. So anyway.\\nAnger, Social Media; Growth & Challenges\\nI\\'m not a psychologist. But knowing your story from what you\\'ve written, what you\\'ve said on social media,\\nand elsewhere, podcasts and here now especially, it\\'s amazing to me, and, frankly, it pulls\\nat my heartstrings a little bit I realize that\\'s not what you\\'re trying to do but that in the course of your childhood and in your young\\nadulthood that no one ever got between you and the world. I forget where I heard it that if a kid has just one\\nperson that believes in them-- and I had my trials and tribulations. But I had great coaches, great mentors.\\nI attached to them. I found them if they didn\\'t necessarily find me. But I\\'m realizing that your situation was no one\\'s ever\\nsaid, hey, I\\'m going to stand here next to you or get in front of you, put a shield up.\\nAnd so it\\'s almost like you\\'ve got these different--\\nit\\'s all you, but there\\'s versions of yourself-- that like you knew social media-- like I don\\'t know\\nthat I have the wherewithal in 2013 \\'14, \\'15, \\'16, \\'17 to get in front of myself while doing\\nall this because I\\'ve already got so much going on in here. Is that about right? DAVID GOGGINS: That is right. But I had developed a lot of anger.\\nAnd I still have it. And it will never go away for the normal human beings\\nof this world because when you put yourself in the sewer like I was in-- and please, if someone saved me,\\ncome out and announce it to the world. There was no one. There\\'s no one.\\nSo when you know that-- and then I\\'m sitting at the table with all these smart people who are telling\\nme what to do and shit and guiding me through my life now when I\\'m 40 fucking years old.\\nIt\\'s 2000-- I don\\'t know 40-something years old. Now I\\'m 49. And I\\'m looking at them all.\\nAnd they\\'re now trying to guide me on what\\'s right on this poison.\\nAnd so, yeah, what you say is right. But for me, it was more of I know now.\\nI don\\'t need you to guide my future. I know what\\'s good for me and what\\'s bad for me.\\nAnd for me, it took every bit of focus I could. And I know social media-- that\\'s why people love to go on there because they want to show\\nyou the good side of life. I\\'m not teaching good side of life.\\nSo I had to figure out a way when I came on 2016 of teaching you what life really is\\nfor the majority of us is hell. And so while people love to show you the cars, and the house,\\nand the vacations and shit, all that\\'s good. All that\\'s happy. I\\'m going to show you the side that I know most of you\\nare going through. And people hide very well. I don\\'t want to hide anymore.\\nI hid it for 24 fucking years. So that\\'s why now when I told you we can talk about whatever you want\\nbecause as human beings, the first thing we have to learn-- I also stuttered real bad growing up.\\nSo if you hear me stutter every now and then, it\\'s because that was part of my life also.\\nSo it\\'s funny. Human beings want to show you the best side. And they want to hide the worst side.\\nFor me, I\\'m going to teach you how to be vulnerable because that\\'s the only way you fix yourself.\\nYou don\\'t fix yourself by coming out here and me selling you some fucking books. That\\'s why I don\\'t have them.\\nI forgot them. I\\'m glad people got something from the book.\\nI want you to learn that the only way you grow is how to look at yourself and say, OK,\\nlike I did, table longer than this, what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere?\\nThere was nothing good on there, nothing. Yeah, I loved playing basketball. I left that out.\\nThat\\'s something I love to do. I don\\'t care about that. That didn\\'t make the fucking list because the list that I had to live by\\nwas the very list that was going to get me at this table with you to talk to you to the normal human beings, which\\nI once was, about how you can get somewhere and how it looks.\\nIt looks very ugly. There\\'s no fucking passion. There\\'s no fucking motivation.\\nThere\\'s no, oh my god, man, I fucking-- no, it\\'s every day of your life just doing,\\nno passion, no discipline, no motivation, all these words. I hate that so many people fucking use these words now\\nbecause it\\'s watered. Someone sitting in the room by themselves and they figure themselves out and say, god, this\\nis going to fucking suck. Where\\'s passion when you\\'re 300 pounds?\\nWhere\\'s the motivation when you can\\'t read and write? Where is it? So how did this happen?\\nI just fucking did. I just did. I said maybe at the end of this journey, there will be something there for me.\\nIf not, I can read. If not, I\\'m 185 fucking pounds.\\nThere was no magic potion. There was no, oh, let me wake up and look at some shit.\\nNo. All those words are overused. They\\'re bullshit. It\\'s all bullshit.\\nJust do. You\\'re living. How do you want to live? How do you want to die?\\nHow do you want to fucking be remembered? That\\'s it. That\\'s it.\\nPeriod. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As many of you know, I\\'ve been taking AG1 daily since 2012.\\nSponsor: AG1\\nSo I\\'m delighted that they\\'re sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that\\'s designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition\\nneeds. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole foods sources that include vegetables\\nand fruits every day. But, oftentimes, I simply can\\'t get enough servings. But with AG1, I\\'m sure to get enough vitamins, and minerals,\\nand the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.\\nI have more focus and energy, and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I\\'m\\nasked if you could take just one supplement what would it be, I answer AG1. If you\\'d like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim\\na special offer. They\\'ll give you five free travel packs plus a year\\'s supply of vitamin D3, K2.\\nAgain, that\\'s drinkag1.com/huberman. The word haunted is ringing in my head.\\nStick vs. Carrot, Negative Inner Dialogue, “Stay Hard”\\nYep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think it\\'s such a powerful word. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I was about to m\\nit seems like a huge part of your process, maybe the entire process, is it\\'s all stick no carrot,\\nyou talk about the carrot, the positive thing. And then there\\'s the stick, the thing you\\'re trying to avoid. I feel like it\\'s-- the way it\\'s landing for me is it\\'s all\\nstick and gas pedal. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There\\'s no carrot. You\\'re not imagining, oh, when I\\'m a paramedic, when\\nthe book is published. And, obviously, you set those goals, and you make those targets. But it\\'s all stick.\\nAll stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that. I\\'m waking up right now studying.\\nLike I have a test tomorrow. I already passed the fucking test.\\nThink about that. Every day in my life, that\\'s what I must do just to retain what I learned.\\nFour hours plus a day, I go through and do that. There\\'s no stick.\\nOr there\\'s only a stick. There\\'s never been a carrot, which is why when I speak to people, I have to figure out\\na way to resonate with them. Because all I want to say to them is let me teach you the real life, how it really is.\\nThe reason why you\\'re a loser and the reason why you\\'re not fucking making it and the reason why you\\'re trying to go to all these--\\nI go to all these fucking conventions, speak all the fucking time. I look in the fucking audience. And these people sign up, sign up,\\nsign up fucking every year go to a convention, thinking they\\'re going to learn something fucking different. No, you\\'re lazy.\\nYou know exactly what to do, exactly what to do. Because even me in my state of I can\\'t read and write,\\nI knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it.\\nIt sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, god, man, I\\'m not smart.\\nSo guess what I got to do. I got to study the same shit that I got one of the highest\\nscores in the nation on and do it again, and do it again, and do it again.\\nIt\\'s not just there. It\\'s not just there permanently for me. So, yeah, it\\'s all stick.\\nIt\\'s all stick. The only carrot you have is like maybe, maybe.\\nBecause whenever I take these tests that are real hard, the back of my brain is like a good chance\\nyou\\'re not going to make it, Goggins. This ain\\'t you, bro. This ain\\'t you.\\nYou weren\\'t born like this. This ain\\'t you. The real you, bro-- study all you want to.\\nBut the second that fucking computer comes on with 150 questions, this ain\\'t you, man.\\nAnd somehow, comes back. I passed. I passed again, passed again.\\nBut that real me back here every fucking time is saying that ain\\'t you, bro.\\nThat ain\\'t you. And I have to outwork that voice.\\nWhen I\\'m taking that test and I get to a question I don\\'t fucking know the answer, I\\'m like fuck, man. And then say, see I told you, man.\\nThat ain\\'t you. You\\'re 300 pounds, man. You sit at home. You figure out how to do your hair.\\nThat\\'s what you do, how to come to school with the reverse baldness when you\\'re 16.\\nThat\\'s you. So there is no get out of jail free card.\\nThis is why I say stay hard. Because when you weren\\'t given the gifts, the only thing you can do in life is stay hard.\\nAnd I know people cannot stand me. They can\\'t stand this talk.\\nThis is all you can do. There\\'s no magic pill or a magic potion.\\nAll you can do is outwork the man that God created or woman in you.\\nAnd what that looks like is unfun. That\\'s why I said, do not do a documentary on me\\nbecause people will not see the truth. They will see what they want to see is I don\\'t want to live like that.\\nGood, good. And you will live exactly the way you live now, questioning who you are,\\nwondering what is possible, wondering what you are capable of doing. That\\'s how that looks or you can be me, which am I happy?\\nI don\\'t know. Never really thought about it. Don\\'t really care about it because all I really cared about was when I looked in that fucking mirror,\\nI saw a piece of shit. Happiness wasn\\'t on the mirror at 16 or when I was 300 pounds.\\nIt wasn\\'t like, I\\'m looking for happiness. No, I\\'m looking at myself in the mirror and say, all right,\\nmotherfucker, you did it again today. You\\'re a bad boy because that shit sucks.\\nI have about a couple of minutes of that that I got the carrot. The second I lay down and go to bed, the carrots gone\\nbecause I\\'m waking up all through the night to check the work I did that day.\\nDid I get this drug right? Did I get this right? Did I get that right? What did I do? Oh my god, fuck, I\\'m already losing it.\\nStick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That stick\\'s haunting you. DAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\\'s following you around.\\nInspiration, Characters & Self Image\\nSo no picture of Jordan on the wall. You\\'re not listening to YouTube inspiration video. DAVID GOGGINS: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would be all your voice anyway.\\nYou\\'re not listening to your top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and then lace the shoes, hit the books.\\nIt\\'s all in here. DAVID GOGGINS: All in there. I used to do that when I was fat. Rocky, I mean, that was my thing.\\nRound 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older and older, that started to go away.\\nAnd I started to create-- I had all these people that I used to watch.\\nRocky was one, Barnes, Elias from \"Platoon,\"\\nJack from \"A Few Good Men\" when he\\'s on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at\\nand I was like, man, I ain\\'t got none of that. But they were characters.\\nAfter a while, I lived a life so disciplined that every body that I once looked\\nto, these fake characters, I built that as a man.\\nAnd when I was younger, I had this image in my mind of what does a man look like to me?\\nAnd I got all these people who are badasses, characters.\\nAnd in my mind, I became that. And that\\'s what kept me going a lot was\\nI had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this and a little bit of that because when you have no parents raising you and you\\nhave no role models growing up, it\\'s not daydreaming.\\nYou start to create a reality like, mm, maybe I can be that.\\nAnd after becoming this guy, that\\nis the biggest thing I can ever do in my life is I became that guy. That I once looked at all these, guys and now\\nI look at myself like, god, who the fuck can do that? I can. But what it takes is a discipline\\nthat no one can ever even-- they don\\'t understand it.\\nThey don\\'t understand it. But everybody has the ability to do it, but they just don\\'t want to. They want to keep asking questions\\nand keep going to seminars. And the greatness is right in you. And that\\'s why once again--\\nI say this a million times here, I do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugarcoat what I\\'m going\\nto say to you because all of you know what I\\'m saying is the truth.\\nEverybody knows it\\'s the truth. This is what it looks like. And you know it too. You know it too.\\nIf you ain\\'t got nothing, I hate to tell you what it looks like. It\\'s ugly. It\\'s not a documentary. It\\'s not an HBO special.\\nYou ain\\'t going to watch me like, hey, man, you guys gotta watch this. No, it\\'s like, oh, god, this looks like a train wreck. It\\'s like a nightmare. This looks like this guy\\'s got-- no, that\\'s what it looks like.\\nHard work looks horrible. It\\'s not motivating. It\\'s not motivating at all.\\nIt ain\\'t like Rocky round 14 where he gets knocked down and goes like this to Apollo Creed. Looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon.\\nAnd there\\'s no fucking way out. But you have the fucking key.\\nBut you refuse to use it. And that\\'s nothing motivating about that. So, yes, no documentary on David Goggins.\\nThe real life-- DAVID GOGGINS: The real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --David Goggins is the documentary. It\\'s already being written.\\nYou\\'re it. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I\\'m going to share a little neuroscience tidbit. DAVID GOGGINS: Love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I think it\\'s one\\nWillpower & Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex\\nthat you\\'ll appreciate. Most people don\\'t know this, but there\\'s a brain structure called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.\\nAs we pointed out before, that\\'s a noun. It\\'s a name. It doesn\\'t mean anything. We could call it the Cookie Monster.\\nBut what\\'s interesting about this brain area is there are now a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study, showing that when people do\\nsomething they don\\'t want to do like add three hours of exercise per day or per week\\nor when people who are trying to diet and lose weight resist eating something, when people do anything\\nthat they, and this is the important part, that they don\\'t want to do, it\\'s not about adding more work. It\\'s about adding more work that you don\\'t want to do.\\nThis brain area gets bigger. Now here\\'s what\\'s especially interesting about this brain area to me. And by the way, I\\'m only learning this\\nrecently because it\\'s new data. But there\\'s a lot of it. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex\\nis smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet.\\nIt\\'s larger in athletes. It\\'s especially large or grows larger\\nin people that see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge.\\nAnd in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size.\\nIn many ways, scientists are starting to think of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower but perhaps actually\\nthe seat of the will to live. DAVID GOGGINS: See, now we\\'re talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And when I learned about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex,\\nI was like almost out of my seat. And I\\'ve been in the neuroscience game since I was 20. DAVID GOGGINS: Now we\\'re talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We\\'re the same age.\\nAnd I was so pumped because I\\'ve heard of the amygdala, fear, prefrontal cortex. It\\'s planning an action.\\nI could tell you every brain area and every-- I teach neuroanatomy to medical students. But when I started seeing the data\\non the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, I was like, whoa,\\nthis is interesting. And all the data point to the fact that we can build this area up.\\nBut that as quickly as we build it up, if we don\\'t continue to invest in things that are hard for us,\\nthat we don\\'t want to do-- that\\'s the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me, that we don\\'t want to do.\\nLike if you love the ice bath-- yeah, I love the ice bath-- and you go from 1 minute to 10 minutes, guess what, your anterior mid-cingulate cortex did not\\ngrow. DAVID GOGGINS: None. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if you hate the cold water, if you\\'re afraid of drowning and you get into water\\nand put your head under and survive, then the anterior mid-cingulate cortex gets bigger.\\nBut if you don\\'t do it the next day or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it because, hey, hey, I did it yesterday,\\nwoo-hoo, happy me, Merry Christmas as you would say-- DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Merry Christmas. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess what, the anterior\\nmid-cingulate cortex shrinks again. To me, this is one of the most important discoveries that neuroscience has ever made because it\\'s\\nthat I don\\'t want to do something but do it anyway that grows this area.\\nAnd it\\'s almost like-- I have a friend. He\\'s been sober 30 years from alcohol. And he always says, the amazing thing about addiction\\nis there\\'s a cure. The problem is it only works one day at a time.\\nAnd so you have to renew it every day. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior mid-cingulate cortex to me-- when I learned about it, two things went off in my head.\\nWhoa, this is super interesting. And, two, I got to tell David Goggins about this. And I waited until now-- DAVID GOGGINS: I\\'m glad.\\n--to tell you because I felt like, well, for obvious reasons I wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here.\\nWell, I love that because that\\'s how I\\'ve lived my entire life. I don\\'t know anything about that.\\nBut people go, man, you have such a strong will. It\\'s something that you build.\\nLike I never forget I was on a podcast one time. And this dude goes you were blessed with a strong mind.\\nLike the hell are you talking about I was blessed with a strong mind?\\nThat\\'s something that you have to develop. You develop that over years, decades of suffering\\nand going back into the suffer. That\\'s why a lot of people who graduate Navy SEAL training,\\nthey want to know-- I talk about it very openly all the time.\\nA lot of guys don\\'t want to go back into that water, don\\'t want to go back into the hard stuff.\\nAnd maybe not-- anything hard, anything hard in life, once you get through it, it\\'s like you become a POW.\\nLike how many POWs you know want to go back to POW camp? None. When something sucks so bad in life--\\nthis is on this that we\\'re talking about now-- very few people want to go back.\\nThey\\'re happy they graduated. I realized I\\'m the same way.\\nI don\\'t want to go back. I have to go back. I must go back because that is exactly where all the knowledge\\nof my life exists was back there in what you\\'re exactly what you\\'re talking about. Well, I didn\\'t know anything about this.\\nBut how I grew a will was constantly doing these things to now it\\'s just life.\\nI wake up. While it still sucks, it\\'s just life. You don\\'t sit back and like, oh my god. Like I have days I don\\'t want to do.\\nBut I know I\\'m going to do it. I know from years of just doing it.\\nSo that\\'s beautiful. And this is why I came on here with you today. And I\\'m glad that you\\'re talking about this because human beings\\nneed to hear this. They need to stop hearing these hacks on this and that.\\nThere\\'s no fucking hack, bro. There\\'s no fucking hack. Yeah, you may this and that and saunas and all this shit\\nthat they-- yeah, it\\'s great. There is no fucking life hack.\\nTo grow that thing-- how do you grow it? Do it, and do it, and do it, and do it.\\nThat\\'s the hack. The hack is going to fucking suck. And that\\'s what I realized. That\\'s what I realized.\\nThat\\'s why I wanted to come on here today. I didn\\'t want to come on here and talk about no fucking passion and purpose\\nand how to get the fuck out of bed and how to hit a fucking alarm clock, all this catchphrase bullshit because that wasn\\'t how\\nI lived, wasn\\'t how I lived. I lived, I woke up like every human being does and goes fuck, man.\\nI\\'m a fucking piece of shit today. How the hell is this going to work out for me? And you fight that.\\nAnd you fight that. You don\\'t override it. There\\'s no override button. It\\'s the conversation in your head.\\nSo how do you do that? We don\\'t have enough of these conversations about the real conversation that every human being is having.\\nAnd they have no idea how to get out of it. But they do is that shit right there, man.\\nYou got to build your will. How you build your will? Exactly what you said, man.\\nExactly what you said. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel like knowing the name of something, anterior mid-cingulate cortex,\\nFriction & the “Suck”, Willpower\\ndoesn\\'t fundamentally change us. But one thing I like about biology is that willpower, if somebody feels they don\\'t have it,\\nfeels like this thing that other people have. But everybody, unless they\\'re brain-damaged, like a hole through their head, has two anterior\\nmid-cingulate cortex, one on each side of their brain. Everyone has one. They have two.\\nSo I feel like it\\'s just a question of opening the portal.\\nAnd the portal-- again, I\\'m going to say 10 times, and forgive me-- is I think people go, oh, I do hard things.\\nI do sets to failure. And then I do forced reps. I love training with weights. I love doing sets to failure.\\nI even like forced reps. But guess what? I like forced reps. So I\\'ll tell you, they don\\'t build\\nmy anterior mid-cingulate cortex because I like to do it. Anything you like to do is not going\\nto enhance this aspect of willpower. And it seems so obvious once you hear it. You kind of go, oh yeah, of course.\\nBut I think you really close that loop for people when you share what you\\'re sharing today\\nand what you\\'ve shared elsewhere before as well. When you\\'re trying to explain the friction is the critical ingredient.\\nAnd I think people think, oh, if it\\'s effort, well, then I\\'m getting better. That\\'s part of it, necessary, but not sufficient,\\nas we say in science. But the suck part, the haunt, being haunted, the stick,\\nthey\\'re really unpleasant terms. These are probably the most unpleasant terms we\\'ve ever used on this podcast.\\nThose are the-- those are the levers. Those are the gears. And without those, this thing that you\\'re talking about,\\nDavid Goggins, as a verb-- I sometimes make the joke, but it\\'s not a joke.\\nGoggins is a name, and it\\'s a verb. People go, I\\'m on to Goggins that.\\nBut that\\'s, I think-- again, I\\'m not a psychologist. But I think that\\'s what you\\'re talking about,\\nthe stick, the friction, being haunted. It\\'s the suck part that grows this anterior mid-cingulate\\ncortex. DAVID GOGGINS: So now you know why there\\'s so many people that fail in this world\\nto figure out their purpose, their purpose in life. Where do I go?\\nBecause to grow that, now, you may not look like me,\\nhow my daily life looks. It don\\'t look fun.\\nDon\\'t look fun. So it\\'s a choice that people have to make in life.\\nBut what\\'s so funny about it is even the richest of rich, who have everything, they always ask me this question.\\nI feel like I\\'m missing something. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m missing shit.\\nI don\\'t have what you all have. But you will never in my life hear me tell you\\nI\\'m missing something. And everybody is. They\\'re missing this feeling.\\nI found it a long time ago. And I found it right there in that willpower thing.\\nWhen you\\'re nothing, nothing, and change yourself into something, like me, you call it happiness, peace,\\nwhatever the fuck you want to call it, people are missing exactly what went on with David Goggins.\\nWhy don\\'t you smile? I do. I do. But I figured something out. That\\'s why I am never--\\nyou never hear me say, I\\'m missing something. I found it years ago. You find it in the suck.\\nYou find it in the suck. And you find it repeatedly in the suck to the point where you know exactly who you are.\\nMost people are missing something because they don\\'t know who they are.\\nThey never examined themselves. They\\'ve never done this experiment on themselves.\\nThe lab rat. We\\'re all lab rats. But you\\'re also the scientist.\\nYou create your own self. Most people are missing something because there\\'s so much trapped in there.\\nI don\\'t even want to say potential. I think that\\'s a word-- it\\'s used out too much too. There\\'s so much in you that God or whoever the hell\\nyou believe in or if you\\'re an atheist in you that you have not unlocked, that you walk around\\nwith this gorgeous wife or great husband and all this money. You\\'re like, god, I feel like I\\'m missing something.\\nYeah, because it\\'s about 75% of you is still fucking in there, still chained up because you just\\ndidn\\'t want to find your willpower, didn\\'t want to find your soul, your will, your heart, your determination, your guts, your courage.\\nAnd what that looks like, it looks scary, like you\\'re little scary lab that went in. Scary to wake up every day and say, I\\'m stupid,\\nbut I\\'m going to figure out a way to be smarter versus saying, man, I just can\\'t do that.\\nSo you limit this box. So your box becomes so small of things you can do.\\nMy box wasn\\'t even a box. It was a fucking little pinhole.\\nAnd then through examining myself, getting some willpower, some courage,\\nit became bigger than this table. But that\\'s what we all do. That\\'s why I wanted to come here today and talk to you about real shit, not no fucking hacks.\\nThere\\'s no hacks, bro. It\\'s you against you. You against you.\\nAnd if you misunderstand that, you have a real problem, real problem.\\nI can understand you misunderstand me, running down the street, shirt off, fuck this, no. Yeah. I can get it.\\nI get it. If you misunderstand what I\\'m saying right now today, the problem is you.\\nAnd you don\\'t want to fix it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the children of wealthy people are a case study in how not having enough friction\\nBuilding Willpower, Brain & “No Days Off” Mentality\\ncan destroy a life. DAVID GOGGINS: True statement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, I could list off prominent names in the press.\\nBut those are actually the least interesting. What\\'s probably more interesting, as an example, is all the ones we don\\'t hear about because we never\\nhear about them. They just dwindle and wither. Or I think there\\'s this big category of people,\\nI\\'m realizing, as we have this conversation today that they\\'re not super successful.\\nThey\\'re not struggling. They\\'re successful enough that they never have to--\\nyou can get to the point where you don\\'t have to impose friction. You even said it. Your bank account is in a place where you don\\'t really\\nneed to do all the things you do, probably not even a small fraction of them. DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. But you realize the stick and being haunted\\nis the fuel and the engine. And you\\'d be a-- you\\'d be truly crazy to give that up\\nbecause you\\'ve internalized all that. But most people, they\\'re good enough for them.\\nAnd so they don\\'t actually want to be better badly enough in order to start going rung after rung.\\nWell, think about when you build willpower. And think about how much I\\'ve built.\\nNow that you know about this-- I didn\\'t know about this. But think about how much I\\'ve built. Everything I\\'ve ever done in my life, I didn\\'t want to do.\\nEverything every day. I\\'m a lazy piece of shit.\\nAnd I\\'m one of the hardest working people to ever step foot on this planet Earth. And I\\'m saying that very proudly because I know what I do.\\nIt\\'s not cocky. I\\'ll tell you I\\'m stupid. And I\\'ll also tell you the exact opposite of what I\\'ve done.\\nIt\\'s the truth. It is the truth. So imagine how much I\\'ve developed in that time frame.\\nBut this is the scary thing. Why most people don\\'t want to do that and build that willpower\\nis because it is scary. It unlocks a whole bunch of things about who you are\\nand who you\\'re not. And a lot of people don\\'t want to go down that journey to discover who they are and who they\\'re not\\nbecause it\\'s not a pretty journey. I mean, I\\'ve gone down it. It\\'s not like I went down it once.\\nI go down it all the time. And when you unlock that-- and you can\\'t just turn it off.\\nLike, people say, hey, how come you haven\\'t retired yet? I built all this willpower.\\nDo you think it\\'s going to let me just retire because my knees hurt?\\nIt is telling me every morning-- I wake up, and I\\'m like, man, my knees hurt. My legs hurt.\\nMy body hurts. But you can still run. So why aren\\'t you running?\\nIf you can still run-- there will be a time when you can\\'t lace them up anymore. But you can still run.\\nSo I still run. When the time comes I can\\'t run, the body will say,\\nyou just can\\'t run. But if I can still do something, that willpower that I have created, it\\nmakes me do it every fucking day. And that\\'s what they don\\'t get. What builds a human being is you start with the small building\\nblocks. And before you know it, man, you become something that it doesn\\'t even make sense to most people because it\\'s just who you are now.\\nThat\\'s why I can still run at 50 with broke-- at 49 with broke down knees and broke down body because my body knows you still can.\\nTherefore, I do. Second you stop, the willpower is gone. And that\\'s beautiful.\\nI\\'m so glad you brought that to me because I always wondered, what\\'s this separation thing now?\\nAt 24 years old, I started building something that I didn\\'t even know was going to be what it is now at 49. And that\\'s all it was.\\nIt was just that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure, anterior mid-cingulate cortex, has inputs and outputs from a bunch of places.\\nBut you\\'ll probably not be surprised to learn that it\\'s strongly activated when we move our body when\\nwe don\\'t want to move our body. I feel like it\\'s like the David Goggins structure.\\nIt really is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. And it also has strong connections to the dopamine reward pathway.\\nAnd everyone goes, yay, dopamine. Everyone loves dopamine. I\\'m partially responsible for people knowing a bit more\\nabout dopamine. But dopamine\\'s badly understood. Everyone thinks dopamine, dopamine hits.\\nIt\\'s about reward. It\\'s about motivation and drive. And there are pain inputs to the dopamine centers of the brain.\\nNo one talks about that. Everyone\\'s like, oh, you want the chocolate, chocolate, sex, cocaine.\\nYeah, that\\'s all true. It\\'ll release dopamine. Pain releases dopamine. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex\\ncan trigger the release of dopamine in response to this thing that we\\'re calling friction. And that\\'s a learned thing.\\nThat\\'s something that no animal or human being comes into the world learning. We all are averse to pain.\\nAnd like pleasure, like sugar, fat. Don\\'t like hot surfaces.\\nBut this is a structure that learns. It has neuroplasticity, the ability\\nto change throughout the entire life span. And here\\'s the part that I think, again, is just neuro nerd speak for what you already know\\nand have done and exemplify, is that people say, oh, it has plasticity. You can change it.\\nBut guess what? It has plasticity in both directions. It can grow. But just as easily as it can grow, it\\'s like Silly Putty,\\nit can shrink. So it requires constant upkeep.\\nAnd that answer isn\\'t one that people are going to like. They\\'re like, give me the energy drink. Give me the supplement.\\nGive me the-- give me the sauna protocol that\\'s going to make my anterior mid-cingulate cortex-- there\\'s someone out there right now who\\'s going,\\nwait, if I took transcranial magnetic stimulation and I stimulate-- yeah, you\\'d probably-- actually, they\\'ve done that.\\nThey stuck a little wire during neurosurgery into this structure. This was actually discovered by a colleague\\nof mine, Joe Parvizi. Stimulate. And the patients go, I feel like there\\'s a storm coming.\\nAnd they go, oh, is it scary? And they go, no, I want to go through it. They come off the stimulation, and people are like--\\nthis is the seat of what we\\'re talking about. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns.\\nSo the fact that you\\'ve kept this brain structure-- I\\'m convinced if we imaged your brain, it\\'d be large,\\nand it would be larger in two years, in a year. But this is the no days off rationale because it can grow,\\nand it can shrink. DAVID GOGGINS: I know. What you\\'re saying right now, I didn\\'t know any of this.\\nAnd I never-- and I always talk to you. But I wish I could just put this on paper.\\nAnd you\\'re saying it in a way that people can understand. I can never put it into words on what I built\\nand the power that is within all of us. But you put it so in a scientific way.\\nMost people, for me, he\\'s just crazy. That\\'s why I don\\'t like talking about it, man.\\nI know I\\'m not crazy. I know what I had to do to get where I had to go. People look at it as crazy because there are people\\nthat just-- if you can\\'t imagine yourself doing something, if you can\\'t imagine yourself doing something,\\nthe person that\\'s doing it is crazy because in your mind, the logic behind it, it doesn\\'t compute.\\nTherefore, you have to give somebody a title. And the title for me is usually he\\'s crazy\\nor he\\'s this, he\\'s that. No. No. For some reason, me wanting to be somebody\\nso fucking bad in my life, I created that. And I\\'ve been trying to figure out\\nyears of my life trying to explain to people. But even though you\\'re explaining it now,\\nthis is the easy fucking part. Them listening to this shit is the easy fucking part.\\nThe part that why they\\'re always be the ones of ones is because putting that practice,\\nputting that into actual work, no, man. No. No.\\nThat\\'s where the demons come in. That\\'s where you\\'re like, I don\\'t want to be better.\\nI don\\'t want to be better. If this is what it takes to be better, I don\\'t want to be better. So everybody\\'s-- that\\'s why there\\'s a lot of average.\\nAnd it makes me so fucking mad. Every day I walk this Earth, and I see average\\nall over the fucking place. And they want to ask me, how did you do it? I can\\'t tell you how because you\\'re not going to fucking--\\nyou\\'re not going to do it. You\\'re not going to do it you. You\\'re just going to-- You\\'re going to continue being like this every day\\nyou wake up. Like you said, it\\'s like, get the coffee. Make the pancakes.\\nKiss the girl. Kiss the kids. You wake up, right to work.\\nImmediate, your mind is in action. No one wants to do that. No one.\\nAnd I don\\'t blame them. But don\\'t be mad when you\\'re laying there in your fucking bed, and you\\'re in the fucking hospital,\\nand you\\'re 70, 80, 90 years old. And you\\'re thinking, man, I feel like I\\ndidn\\'t fucking do something. Because you did. You didn\\'t do it. You didn\\'t do shit.\\nYou may have lived a great life, man, but you\\'re always going to feel empty inside. I don\\'t feel empty. So call me what you want.\\nThere\\'s not one empty bone in my fucking body because I have figured out that really--\\nthe magic potion, at least to my life. And it\\'s very rewarding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\\'d like to take a quick break\\nSponsor: InsideTracker\\nand thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\nto help me better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I\\'ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done\\nfor the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\nNow, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones\\nand so forth. But you don\\'t know what to do with that information With InsideTracker, they make it very easy, because they have a personalized platform, that\\nallows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera. But it gives you specific directives\\nthat you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera that can help you bring\\nthose numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.

You should have seen me in high school.\\nI always laugh. Like, yeah, OK. Got it. And it\\'s not just guys. You should have seen me working out in high school.\\nI was super fit. People will look back to a time where they felt like they were capable of something.\\nAnd now they\\'re not. And you kind of want to just grab them and go, wait. That was you then. It\\'s you now.\\nAnd but people tend to think about how the conditions that were around success\\nmust have been part of it. And you can understand why. It\\'s very rational. I was in that situation.\\nI was successful. I\\'m in this situation. I\\'m not. That was the past. This is the present.\\nErgo, capable. You see how people get into these loops. And as you mentioned, you spent the first 20 years of your life\\nin extremely challenged circumstances. And then you can see how people get to a point\\nwhere everything feels hard. Like, when you\\'re 300 pounds-- I haven\\'t ever been 300 pounds.\\nBut I can\\'t imagine it feels good to get up and move around. DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s defeating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend.\\nHe\\'s in excess of 300 pounds. We\\'ve been trying on him for years. But no win.\\nAnd he\\'s got crazy psoriasis on the back of his calves. And he actually smells bad sometimes\\nbecause he can\\'t wash as well as he would. He\\'s big, big. And it pulls all my sympathy.\\nBut life is very hard for him and getting worse. He\\'s a young guy with a lot of medical issues now, for obvious reasons.\\nAnd so I think people like that think, well, it\\'s already hard. Why would I make it harder?\\nYour message is a little different. And you have the life experience. DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s a lot different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You\\'ve been there.\\nSo for me, saying, oh yeah, lose weight-- I was a skinny guy who got to be a less skinny guy.\\nSo I don\\'t really have a foot to stand on.\\nWhat do you say to those people who are like, listen, getting up in the morning is hard.\\nTrying to not dissolve into a puddle of my own tears and my own misery is hard.\\nYou know why people connect with my books so well? For some reason, God put me in almost every fucked up\\nsituation on the planet Earth. So when I talk to people, it\\'s not sugar-coated\\nbecause I\\'m not saying it from I was a 175 pounds my whole life.\\nI don\\'t say much to those people. Maybe you\\'re a piece of shit.\\nMaybe you want to be nobody. Maybe you\\'re happy exactly where you are in life because obviously, you are.\\nMaybe you don\\'t have the determination to be somebody better than who you are. And if you want to live with that, I\\'ll support you in that.\\nIf you\\'re good with being who you are, that every day you wake up, and every day, you smell like shit because you\\ncan\\'t wash your body well, and your skin is messed up because your health\\'s so bad, and you can\\'t put your clothes on right, you need help with that.\\nYou need help like-- when I was 300 pounds, I needed help wiping my ass. That makes you feel good?\\nNothing I can say to you. If every day you wake up with this-- see, people are haunted.\\nBut they obviously like horror films because they keep watching the same fucking movie. I don\\'t like horror films.\\nA lot of people like horror films. So I don\\'t say much to them. I say exactly what I said to you right there\\nbecause I was once you. I didn\\'t like horror films, so I changed it.\\nSome people are just-- they become-- like you said, it gets real small when you\\'re lazy and you\\'re fat, your will.\\nTheir will is so small that they don\\'t have any. And you can\\'t give it to them.\\nThere has to be something-- this is what I\\'m talking about now because this isn\\'t a hack.\\nThis has to be in you. Something in you has to wake up.\\nAnd usually, the only person that can wake it up is you. Sometimes you can read a David Goggins book\\nbecause I was all this shit and then a lot more of fucked up. But if you don\\'t have a little flame, just barely--\\nyou\\'re done. I can\\'t light it for you. And that\\'s the harsh reality of this life\\nthat I want to get across so fucking bad. You can watch me. You can watch you. You can watch fucking Rogan and Cameron\\nHanes, all these motherfuckers. You can go to Tony Robbins\\'s fucking bullshit, all this shit.\\nYou can do all this shit. You\\'re going to keep going back and keep\\nspending money and spending money and spending money with no results. You\\'re going to wonder, wow.\\nMaybe let me go try out David Goggins. He ain\\'t going to fucking help you.\\nYou have to explore, examine the insides of yourself.\\nAnd what do you really want out of life? Your friend and a lot of people out here just don\\'t fucking want it.\\nSo guess what? Have fun with your life. Go from 300 to 350 to 400 to 450 to 500\\nbecause you don\\'t want it. And that\\'s the harsh reality.\\nI can\\'t give you shit. You can\\'t give them shit. We can give you ideas.\\nBut end of the day, when I was losing the weight, I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold\\nbecause it was Indiana, November, when it started. I was miserable.\\nThis is your new life. Take it or leave it. There\\'s no happiness about it.\\nThere\\'s no peace behind it. It sucks. It just fucking sucks.\\nAnd that\\'s the one thing, if I could teach anybody anything, it just fucking sucks.\\nAnd it\\'s going to continue to suck. And then one day, you\\'ll get to a special part in your life\\nthat it might get a little bit better. But to lose the weight you have to lose, my friend, sorry.\\nIt\\'s going to suck every fucking day because then when you\\'re 300 pounds, you\\'re going to go out to lose weight, you could probably get injured.\\nSo then you got to work on the injury. And then you get even more depressed. This is what I went through. And then you\\'re hungry because now you\\'re depressed.\\nIt\\'s just a vicious cycle. And if you\\'re not strong mentally and you have no willpower, you\\'re\\ngoing to continue falling back in this hole versus the man that sits back and goes, all right, motherfucker.\\nThis is why I cuss because this is what is in me. This is what it took for me to be me.\\nSorry. It didn\\'t take, hey, OK, we\\'re going to do this today. No. This fucking really sucks.\\nThis is real, dude. This is real. And every day, I\\'m set back.\\nI\\'m set back. I\\'m set back. I\\'m set back. So this is what I would tell your boy. This is exactly what I\\'d tell him.\\nEvery day you wake up, you\\'re going to probably be set back for the first four weeks before you lose significant weight because the mind is\\ngoing to be fucking with you the whole time. There\\'s no dopamine. There\\'s no dopamine in there at 300 pounds.\\nYou got nothing. Your hormones are shot. You have to envision something that is more powerful than you.\\nSomething has to get you out of bed. And you have to create it. It has to be false because you\\'re not it.\\nYou\\'re a fat piece of shit. And that\\'s the reality of it. So you have to create a false reality, to live in that\\njust to get to work on yourself. That\\'s the reality.\\nHe\\'ll see this, and he\\'ll appreciate that message. We\\'ll see what he does. DAVID GOGGINS: We\\'ll see.\\nSo far, last 13 years, it\\'s been no movement. But I have had other friends who were\\ndrug and alcohol addicts who quit after one conversation. Never went back. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s awesome.\\nThat means they want it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just one guy, I won\\'t out him, but walked up to me at a party in 2019, July 4th party,\\nand said, I\\'m a pile. And I go, what? And he goes, I\\'m a pile. Look at me. I\\'m 60 pounds overweight.\\nAnd I go, do you drink? He goes, every day. I go, how much? He goes, a case. He goes, I smoke a lot of weed.\\nBut he\\'s successful in other areas of his life. And so I said, well, here\\'s what I know.\\nQuit alcohol and weed for you. I\\'m not telling people what to do. Don\\'t eat until PM.\\nGet on an exercise bike, and pedal in the morning like someone\\'s chasing you with a poison dart\\nuntil you want to puke. And I was kind of half-joking. And then two months later, he was, like,\\nI haven\\'t had a drink. I lost 30 pounds. He lost those 60 pounds. He never went back. Now, he\\'s super fit.\\nIt\\'s amazing. So some people flip the switch. He is very self-critical by nature.\\nSelf-Criticism & Discipline; Recovery; Stutter & Building Confidence\\nThat\\'s what flips-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He\\'s super self-critical. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. That\\'s what flips the switch.\\nThink about it, man. We know what to do. We don\\'t need Andrew Huberman to tell us what to do.\\nWe know what to do, every one of us. That\\'s why he flipped it so fast because he knew what to do.\\nHe didn\\'t go by your exact protocol. He didn\\'t go by the exact--\\nno. He knew exactly what to do. And you just saying some shit to him, it woke something up.\\nHe knew what to do. And that\\'s the thing that people need to get that. You know what to do.\\nWhy aren\\'t you doing it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I\\'m talking about myself now. Those modes of just kind of passive consumption,\\nthey\\'re so easy to wash over us. I used to have this thing, and I\\'m fighting this now because I knew we were going to have this conversation\\ntoday, where I like to start things on the hour or the half hour. Worst practice in the world for me\\nbecause if I miss that half hour, I\\'m like, oh, it\\'s . I\\'ll start at .\\nAh, it\\'s . I\\'ll start at . I just lost time.\\nAnd so this is so stupid. And the other day, I was like, man, I got to tell David about this because my new thing is I start\\nno matter what time it is. If I wake up in the middle of the night-- I got a friend. He paints in the middle of the night.\\nI\\'m like, you\\'re an insomniac? He\\'s like, I don\\'t know. I just do it. Then sometimes he goes back to sleep. Sometimes he doesn\\'t.\\nEveryone\\'s got their thing. But I thought about this. I\\'m like, no more am I going to say I\\'m starting at because I know me.\\nIf I miss the ding and then my pen\\'s not hitting the paper or I\\'m not typing on the keyboard,\\nI\\'m not going to do it. But That\\'s a self-admitted weakness. DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man.\\nI had that for a lot of years. I know I\\'m going to do it.\\nThat\\'s the haunting part is that it\\'s going to happen.\\nIt has to happen. And that\\'s a fact. Like, there\\'s no get out of jail free card, bro.\\nNone. Like, that is a life that I don\\'t know. I don\\'t have that ability.\\nOr I have the ability. I don\\'t have the-- I\\'m not good enough, smart enough.\\nI\\'m not talented enough to do that.\\nSome people are. Some people can start at . Some people don\\'t have to start at all.\\nIf you lack talent, you can\\'t sit back and say,\\nI\\'ll start in half an hour. I can\\'t do that. I got to start now.\\nAnd after I get back from starting, I got to start again. And then when I get done with that run or that study session,\\nif it wasn\\'t good enough, I got to go back again because repetition is what taught me everything.\\nSo you can honestly outwork anything. But it\\'s that you, obviously, are a very talented man.\\nWell, I have worked hard at certain things and built up some things that I\\'ve\\nbeen good at most of my life. DAVID GOGGINS: You\\'re amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering, organizing, and disseminating information\\'s something I\\'ve been\\ndoing since I was a little kid. I used to give lectures at school on Monday about stuff I learned over the weekend. DAVID GOGGINS: See, check that out.\\nBut they took me to a psychiatrist. We\\'re the same age. Back then, if you got sent to a psychiatrist, people thought you were crazy.\\nI was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly. DAVID GOGGINS: I was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So I remember feeling like a freak. Also, I didn\\'t have a stutter, but I had a grunting tic.\\nIt comes back when I\\'m tired. And the only thing that helped that was hitting my head on something, shaking my head,\\nwhich is why skateboarding was good because I\\'d slam, and I\\'d feel like, oh. I feel good. But that\\'s not healthy.\\nThat\\'s not good. Or just work. Work is what gets it out. It\\'s like an-- it\\'s like an RPM or high.\\n[REVVING SOUND] Anyway, that\\'s me. But yeah, I think certain things over time, I feel like talent or gifts or whatever you want to call them,\\nbut there are many things that are exceedingly difficult for me. And I have learned from your example.\\nI know that you are very both humble and very clear that you don\\'t have-- you say, you\\'re\\nnot going to get it by examining you. But I think the way you\\'re sharing today and the way you\\'ve shared it on other podcasts before,\\nthere are pieces that really help people feel into the process of what\\nyou\\'re talking about today. We\\'re elaborating on it, I think, a lot, this notion of being haunted and the stick.\\nI mean, of course, of course, now it makes so much sense why you don\\'t want to talk about sleep or rest or recovery\\nbecause that\\'s-- sure, that\\'s important. I\\'ve heard you say, yes, you sleep. Yes, you eat. Yes, you hydrate.\\nYes, you will stretch your psoas or whatever. But it\\'s funny how that becomes the viral message. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s why I said fuck that today.\\nBut that\\'s not the unique-- that\\'s not the unique message that you carry.\\nLike, anyone can talk about that. So do I have that right? That you\\'re acknowledging sleep is important.\\nRecovery is important. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that\\'s not what you\\'re about. DAVID GOGGINS: You have to forego something. Yes.\\nIce baths. Saunas. Sleep. Nutrition. All this shit\\'s so fucking important, dude.\\nI don\\'t have time for some of it. To extract what I had to extract, something had to give.\\nLike, you talk about you when you were younger. You would give these speeches and stuff.\\nThe same age you were giving speeches, I was trying to figure out how to say the without stuttering.\\nAnd I realized, as I got older, that all these things are important.\\nBut for me to stop stuttering, I got to build fucking confidence.\\nAnd speech therapy didn\\'t help that. Nothing helped that. I have to forgo a lot of shit to be as fucked up\\nas I am to build confidence, for me to stand in a fucking room of 10,000-- of one person, and not\\n[STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be like, oh, and put my head down. Let me look around. Let me read these paragraphs first.\\nAnd then before I read the paragraphs, because they\\'re calling me next, let me just leave the room because I\\'m going to stutter.\\nThat\\'s a miserable life. And that\\'s one of many things I did besides lying,\\nbesides being insecure, besides being immature, besides being fat, besides being one of the only Black kids\\nin my school. There\\'s a lot of things I had to overcome to gain confidence.\\nAnd in doing so, a lot of that had to go. A lot of it. So I became the guy that became, once again, misunderstood.\\nYou only sleep four hours a day, two hours a day? Sometimes you don\\'t sleep at all? Like, what\\'s this, and what\\'s this, and what\\'s this?\\nI know it\\'s all important. I can\\'t. Something\\'s got to go.\\nFor me to get confidence, because confidence is the building block of where I\\'m trying to go,\\nfor me to gain confidence in myself, this fucked up kid has got to do a lot of fucked up shit\\nto gain confidence. And along the way, the stutter went away. And I gained confidence.\\nAnd now, my life is a little bit more-- there is no balance.\\nThere is no balance. It\\'s a little bit more what it should be for a lot of people.\\nBut there\\'ll never be balance because confidence is something that you\\'re constantly-- confidence and belief you\\'re building every day.\\nAnd so something\\'s got to give. And I\\'m willing to forego a lot of things to have that because I know if you\\nwant to give somebody kryptonite, take that shit away from them. So yeah, I don\\'t sleep sometimes.\\nAnd sometimes I don\\'t eat the right way. And sometimes I don\\'t do this and do that and whatever, man. But you put me in a room of 10,000 people any time\\nof the day, and I\\'ll walk in there thinking I\\'m the baddest motherfucker in here because I know what it took to be on this stage.\\nAnd a lot of people would not do that. So that\\'s what it takes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There\\'s a question\\nRelationships & Honest Conversations, People Pleasing\\nI\\'ve been wanting to ask you since we started. And I thought about coming in here. And I\\'ve been thinking about in the weeks ahead of this.\\nAnd I\\'m going to just come clean and say I don\\'t exactly know how to ask the question. DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it.\\nIt\\'s about relationships. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I know in myself\\nthat my discipline is much higher when it\\'s just me. But that\\'s because I had certain things early on.\\nBut then I was a terrible student. Barely finished high school. But then when I got serious, I got serious. But I did that by staying away from everybody.\\nAnd anyone\\'s who\\'s ever had a relationship of any kind, but in particular, romantic relationships,\\nknows that, yes, you can derive tremendous support from those. Like, you got this, baby. You can go.\\nAnd you\\'re like, yeah. I got this. She said I got this. Feels great to finish something and share with someone,\\nshare a meal, get the hug. But there\\'s another side to all of that\\nthat I\\'d like to learn more about from you, which is there\\'s a warm body next to you\\nin bed in the morning. You don\\'t want to get up. They also have needs. You\\'ve got your mission that people sometimes\\nneed things from us. But also, oftentimes, the people that love us most, that truly love us and that want to support us,\\ndon\\'t understand this thing. And they\\'re the first people to tell us, like, listen.\\nTake a day off. And then this whole cycle, at least in my head, goes off, like, you just want a vacation.\\nAnd then it\\'s almost like a paranoia. I\\'m not saying anything nice about myself right now. DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Former girlfriends\\nare going to be like, yeah. Like, they remember that. And so support of people close to you is critical.\\nThis could be friends. Could be romantic partners. Whatever. But they\\'re also-- the knife cuts both ways.\\nIt can be the thing that can really undermine this thing that you\\'re talking about because people that care about us also want to see us comfortable.\\nThey want to see us happy. They want to see us peaceful. They want to see us wake up from a great night\\'s sleep. And they want things too.\\nSo how do you untangle that whole bit? DAVID GOGGINS: Well, it\\'s funny, man. I\\'m unbalanced, but I\\'m mostly unbalanced\\ntowards the family side, which people don\\'t get about me. I\\'ll start being unbalanced. I get all my stuff in.\\nBut what I do is I make sure that my family has everything they need, everything they need, those who\\nwant to be part of my family. Some don\\'t. Some family members don\\'t want to be part of David Goggins.\\nI get it. I got it. That\\'s life. Those who are part of my family, I\\ngive them everything they need so they can leave me the fuck alone.\\nI make sure you\\'re happy as fuck because I got to go to work. And I don\\'t mean smokejumping.\\nI don\\'t mean running. I mean all of it. It takes every--\\nI can\\'t have you in my fucking shit. I can\\'t. So I know for me to have a family,\\nI gotta make sure that you realize I\\'m going to give you everything you need. So when you start bitching at me, I\\'m going to say, look, hang on.\\nI dedicated my life to give you everything you need. I need this time right here for me\\nto be the best I can be because this journey started without anybody. And I make sure everybody knows that who comes in my life.\\nI\\'ve been left-- think about it. I was left alone at a young age to figure this shit out.\\nI figured it out for myself and have been very successful for myself. No one\\'s going to come in here and fuck with my shit.\\nThat\\'s why I make sure I will take care of whatever you need. Whatever you need from me, you got it. Money, house, my love, my support,\\nI\\'m going to give you everything you need. That said, I do it the highest level possible.\\nAnd I\\'m saying that with Jennifer in the next room. So please come here and say something if it\\'s wrong, Jennifer. I don\\'t give a fuck. Say what you got to say.\\nSo then when it\\'s time for me to go to work, I expect you to do the same for me\\nbecause it takes every bit of me to do what I have to do. So I make sure that I\\'m very unbalanced from my family\\nso I can be exactly that unbalanced for myself. And that\\'s how I do it.\\nI let people know right up front, I\\'m not what you want in a man.\\nI guarantee that. There\\'s going to be a lot of late nights, a lot of early mornings, a lot of times\\nwhere I got to be by myself thinking about the process that is next in my mind.\\nI can\\'t have aggravation. I can\\'t have this. Can\\'t have that. There\\'s a lot of things. But I let them know up front.\\nI\\'m very vocal about that. Sometimes relationships work for me. Sometimes they didn\\'t.\\nBut that\\'s who I am. One thing I did wrong in my life was I tried for so many years to please people.\\nAnd I did it at the expense of myself.\\nI was leaving a lot in the tank. And when you do that, you stop living.\\nBut the person in your life is happy as fuck because you\\'re giving them everything they want.\\nThey have their-- their life is full. But you feel empty. And that\\'s not a relationship to me.\\nSo for me, it\\'s important that you know exactly who I am because this is what life made.\\nAnd I\\'m not trying to change it because I just figured it out. So I\\'m not trying to compromise David Goggins.\\nI would never, ever compromise David Goggins. That doesn\\'t mean I won\\'t give you what you need\\nand what you want and what you desire. But I don\\'t need money. I don\\'t need fame.\\nI don\\'t need shit. So I give it all away. What I do need is to make sure that that willpower is worked\\non every fucking day and every night for the rest of my life because that\\'s the one thing that\\'s\\ngoing to keep me feeding you, keeping you where you need to be, because once that willpower is gone,\\n300-pound David Goggins, he may not look like it, but I will walk around with it.\\nSo the things that are important to you in life, you must do always. Or you\\'re nobody.\\nAnd that\\'s how I handle relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that. Something I could personally work on\\nis that upfront, clear communication because it resonates that feeling of there\\'s something\\ninside that\\'s not getting worked out that, when I\\'m on my own, it\\'s a lot easier.\\nBut then, of course, wanting relationships and family, I think that\\'s a healthy part of being human too. And obviously, you\\'ve worked it out.\\nSo I appreciate you sharing that. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard you talk about it that way before. DAVID GOGGINS: People are scared of that conversation\\nwith their wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend. But why are you scared of it?\\nWhy are you scared to tell a motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are, who you are, exactly who you are?\\nAnd that was the problem I had-- that\\'s a problem that a lot of us have in life. No one knows who you really are.\\nNo one knew who I really was. I went to a school where there were a lot of Black kids.\\nA lot of Black kids didn\\'t want to be in special ops. I never talked about special ops to Black kids.\\nWhy? I was wondering what-- I\\'m not going to fit in.\\nThat\\'s not what they do. A lot of Black kids don\\'t do that kind of shit. So whatever I wanted to do, no one really\\nknew the real me growing up because I never wanted anybody to know the real me. I was always afraid of what you might say\\nor how you\\'re going to feel or whatever. You got feelings. You have a life that you have to live.\\nSo it\\'s important that whatever\\'s on your mind, you let that person know. Therefore, you\\'re giving them the option\\nto be with you or not. This is who I am. If you don\\'t like it, that\\'s good, man.\\nI got it. But this is David Goggins. So that honest conversation is very important, man,\\nso everybody knows where they stand. That person may not be for you. And that\\'s all good.\\nSelf-Reflection & Empowerment\\nThis world could use a lot more of that upfront, completely honest conversation. I feel like so much of the world\\'s problems\\nare because everyone\\'s dancing around these issues. DAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently in the news, seeing people losing their job because they\\nwon\\'t say something publicly. You can tell they kind of what it. It\\'s like, people just, I think, deep down really\\ncrave the direct message. Like, what are you about? What are you not about? But I think now, everyone\\'s afraid of getting canceled.\\nIt\\'s a big deal, getting canceled, that people think, oh, I can\\'t work if I am who I am. Or if I\\'m not pretending to be somebody else,\\nthen silence is considered agreement. There\\'s all sorts of complicated stuff.\\nAnd I do feel for the generation coming up because we didn\\'t have social media and all of that.\\nAgain, just walled off from that. There\\'s a real benefit from just not paying attention. DAVID GOGGINS: People love to lie.\\nPeople love to lie. You know, I thought I was only a person-- when I was growing up, I thought I was the only person that lied because I lived in a bubble.\\nAnd people love to lie about who they\\'re not. They love to lie about who they\\'re not, dude.\\nAnd that\\'s, for me, the reason why I\\'m so vulnerable,\\nand I\\'m so real and honest. Find somebody to come out and tell me\\nI\\'m lying about my fucking life. And for me to come where I came from and have the resume I have now, you\\nknow the confidence you get? How I don\\'t care who-- you\\'re going to-- you\\'re going to judge me?\\nYou\\'re going to judge me? What have you done in your life? So me, being so honest and so upfront and so truthful,\\nthat came with me finally figuring out who I was,\\nbut also conquering David Goggins, the demons of David Goggins. Therefore, now, you\\'re just an open book.\\nYou look at somebody, look them right in the eye. Tell me exactly who the fuck you are. You walk away. I\\'m good, bro, because I know exactly what this journey took\\nto get here. And that gives you a fire and a passion that people can call you nigger, they can call you--\\nif you\\'re a lesbian or gay or bise-- call me whatever the fuck you want. If you put yourself in the fire and you come out\\nevery fucking day like this, brush it off, not scared to go back in there again, come on, man.\\nYour truth is real. You come out every day, man, with a way of talking to people that people don\\'t have because there\\'s\\nno truth behind them. And the truth is the starting line. When you sit down the ugly mirror and say, I\\'m this,\\nI\\'m this, I\\'m this and this, you finally started your life. Maybe 40 years old.\\nMaybe 40 years old, five, six kids, wife. But the second you look in that mirror and you say, I\\'m this,\\nI\\'m this, I\\'m this, I\\'m this, I\\'m this, well, basically, I\\'m not this, I\\'m not this, I\\'m not this, I can\\'t do this,\\nI can\\'t do this, I\\'m all these insecurities, your life finally started. And once you start that life, man, the truth\\ncomes out big time because you no longer care. So that\\'s the problem. Most people just don\\'t want to have that conversation\\nto the point where they can go on stage and a million people and say, I\\'m all of this.\\nAnd have a good day. See you. It\\'s empowering.\\nIt\\'s very empowering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like the way we\\'re educated in school, but also outside of school, is we\\'re trained, as human being,\\nas these young brains, to try and figure out how to get positive feedback from other people. It\\'s like we\\'re little dogs.\\nYou have a bulldog. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I had a bulldog. Saw the picture of your bulldog. She\\'s great.\\nCharlie dog. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They\\'re an amazing species. DAVID GOGGINS: They are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think of them economy of effort\\nor amazing breed, excuse me. They\\'re an amazing breed. Economy of effort. They don\\'t do anything unless it\\'s necessary.\\nIt\\'s the exact opposite of everything we\\'re talking about. It\\'s kind of interesting. And they\\'re kind of hedonists.\\nNow, it is true that they\\'ll die to protect you. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it\\'s an instinct.\\nI saw that with Costello. I\\'m sure that-- DAVID GOGGINS: I saw it with Charlie. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\\'s an instinct. But if they\\'re not in that position,\\nif there\\'s no need to exert effort-- DAVID GOGGINS: They\\'re resting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So your bulldog\\'s resting for you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\\nGot it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So you don\\'t need to rest because-- DAVID GOGGINS: Active recovery Charlie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s it.\\nPerfect. That\\'s going to be your answer from now on. People go, does he sleep? Does he rest? Go, no. He somehow worked it out so his bulldog does it for him.\\nRight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But we\\'re sort of indoctrinated into this way of being\\nUnseen Work, Real Passion & Purpose, Medicine Cabinet Analogy\\nfrom a time that we\\'re young, where, of course, praise feels good. Someone tells you, hey, I like that shirt, or good job today,\\nor nicely done. Or for me, because growing up in a big pack of friends growing\\nup, and I was never the greatest athlete, wasn\\'t terrible, wasn\\'t great, et cetera, like, a fist bump, or, like, feeling\\ncrewed up. And you\\'re just like, yeah. But you\\'ve talked about this before in reference to the SEAL Teams.\\nWe both know a lot of people in that community. And the Teams component is a big part of it for a lot of people. And it\\'s a wonderful thing.\\nBut there\\'s a danger to that dopamine hit, for lack of a better way to put it,\\nfrom we can only derive when it\\'s coming from the outside.\\nYou\\'re talking about being able to either say, good job, but also, just look to one\\'s own personal history and say,\\nI\\'ve done hard things. And I can do it again and again because I do it again and again and again. You\\'re talking about parenting yourself, inspiring yourself,\\nscaring yourself, all of that from the inside. So very different than the way we\\'re\\nraised, which is to figure out how to get the biscuit. DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s funny, man. People want to know how I\\'m always motivated.\\nIt\\'s the unseen work, which you just said is a true statement. Those are false dopamine hits that people\\nare giving you, man. There\\'s no belief in that. These are teamwork dopamine-- like, I\\'m out\\nrunning at 2 o\\'clock in the morning, 1 o\\'clock in the morning in the gym, long sessions by myself.\\nThat\\'s real. I\\'m able to extract dopamine, the good dopamine whenever\\nI want. Man, I\\'ve trained 99% of my life alone.\\nNo one patted me on the back. I did all of the work alone.\\nAnd while I\\'m still hard on myself, I know what I did. So whenever times get bad for me,\\npeople are all this, who\\'s going to carry the boats and lo-- that\\'s real. I hate that people know me for that guy\\nbecause that guy is not every fucking day. When they see me, they want that energy.\\nThat\\'s not me every day. I can extract it immediately when I need to because when you train alone--\\nand I lived alone for so many years in this misery. And you\\'re able to get out by yourself.\\nI can take myself to such a level of real passion and purpose.\\nAnd the feeling I get is something I can\\'t even explain by mys-- I don\\'t need anyone.\\nThat\\'s why people come to me to motivate them. No one can motivate me. I have a resume full of fucking motivation\\nthat whenever I\\'m down, I\\'m like, oh hang on, motherfucker. Oh, you know the truth.\\nYou know the truth. You know the darkness of the fucking dungeons and the fucking demons that fly. And then from there, it\\'s like, OK.\\nYou were there. You know this. There was no one there to pick up the rucksack, to pick up the boat, to pick up\\nthe log, to go in there. It was you. It was you. There was no pat on the fucking back at 300, at 275, at 250,\\nat 220. No. That was you. So those things that come out of me,\\nthat extract from me in the darkness, people are looking for that pat on the back. Where is it?\\nOh, I don\\'t need it because what I\\'ve done is in the fucking unseen work.\\nI built Frankenstein. So whenever shit gets nasty, David Goggins\\ngoes, you had nobody anyway, motherfucker. So see how I\\'m talking to myself right now? That\\'s me.\\nThat\\'s shit fires me the fuck up. That shit makes me fucking nuts. You had nobody anyway, motherfucker.\\nLook around you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up,\\nsaying you can do it, you can be better, trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing.\\nRock bottom. You did that. So as times get hard for me, the truth comes out.\\nAnd my truth is powerful as fuck. It\\'s real. It\\'s tangible.\\nI feel it. It comes out of my brain as I speak about it. I\\'m reliving every single dark moment of my life to be here.\\nSo that is what people don\\'t get. That is what motivates David Goggins is the unseen work.\\nBut everybody needs that pat on the back. They need that training partner. They need that accountability coach.\\nI don\\'t need that shit. And neither do they. But it\\'s what we\\'ve trained ourselves to believe that we need.\\nIt\\'s almost like there\\'s this pill on the shelf. I\\'m speaking in analogy.\\nAnd we take it, and we get jazzed up. And we\\'re like, yeah. But there\\'s this other medicine cabinet behind there.\\nAnd it\\'s in us. You\\'re saying the real medicine cabinet is inside. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes. When you continue to overcome--\\nand I had so many obstacles to overcome. So it\\'s actually a benefit to me. But the benefit, it\\'s not like a benefit like that.\\nYou have to have the courage and the patience to overcome and overcome. Before you know it, man, you have a whole medicine cabinet.\\nBut there\\'s no medicine in the motherfucker. There\\'s no pre-workout. I don\\'t take none of that shit.\\nAll I got to do is flip my brain. Put my finger in there and say, OK, that\\'s a good one.\\nIt\\'s all I got to do, man. I got the Rolodex. I\\'m just like, go fuck yourself, Goggins. And oh, but you won.\\nLet\\'s do that one today. There\\'s nothing I need. And this is the thing that people\\ndon\\'t get about David Goggins. I can\\'t teach it in a 1-minute video.\\nWe all have this ability to have our own medicine cabinet.\\nBut unless you go in there and put the medicine in there,\\nit\\'s always going to be fucking empty, man. You\\'re always going to need the pre-workout. You\\'re always going to need the-- I don\\'t drink coffee.\\nI don\\'t do ca-- I don\\'t do none of that. I don\\'t need it. I can run for 70 hours, and I have before, no caffeine.\\nI got all this wonderful shit that I overcame on my own, by myself, in the darkness, that, man, when it\\'s cold,\\nI\\'m hot. When it\\'s hot-- I can feed myself all the time.\\nThat\\'s why when people say, man, why aren\\'t you missing anything, I can\\'t explain it to you, man.\\nCan\\'t explain it to you. You\\'ll never understand. That\\'s why I don\\'t do all these podcasts, dude.\\nI love you, man. That\\'s why you-- my first book, you did a blurb for me.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m here. I love what you\\'re doing for people, man. But I can\\'t explain this.\\nI can\\'t. I can\\'t explain this because people don\\'t want to do this. They don\\'t want to do this, man. But I don\\'t know, man.\\nI get jazzed up even talking about it, man, because so many people think my life is just so, oh\\ngod, his life is horrible. Don\\'t follow him. He\\'s crazy. Really? ANDREW HUBERMAN: But there are a good number of people,\\nFeeling Lost, Self-Reflection & Individual Process\\nI would say, and that\\'s an under-- that actually do. I think what I\\'m hearing today, and it\\'s really sinking in, is\\nthat a great many people either partially or completely misunderstand you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\\nI\\'ll put myself in the partially category. DAVID GOGGINS: Big time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I thought it was about just forward center of mass, carrot, carrot,\\ncarrot, carrot. But it\\'s the stick. DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s the stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it\\'s being haunted. And you know, I do have examples from my own life, which is not\\nwhat today is about, about being really afraid and then turning things around. My biggest fear is getting comfortable.\\nI do not have as much of a stick-oriented approach. But today\\'s conversation\\'s changing the way I think.\\nI\\'m not going to step away from this and think, OK, there are 25 neural circuits that can explain 10 of the things that David\\'s talking about.\\nAnd what I\\'m thinking about is the fact that everybody has a brain. They have a mind.\\nForget the brain. The brain\\'s just the physical structure. But what that manifests, what that creates is the mind.\\nAnd everybody has that. So I do believe that everyone has the capacity to do what you\\'re talking about at some level.\\nI also will be the first to confess that I think you are highly unusual.\\nLet\\'s just say maybe even n of 1, as we say in science. Sample size of one.\\nSomebody who has created this process for themselves and keeps them in this-- themselves in this forward center of mass with the stick\\nbattering the back of their head all the time. Highly unusual.\\nBut this internal medicine cabinet that you\\'re talking about building up, true confidence, not needing anything from the outside,\\nI like to think that people want that. They want to be known.\\nThey\\'re afraid. But that they want to be known for who they really are and that you\\'re describing the path to do this.\\nAnd I will say I\\'m immensely grateful that you\\'re talking to us this way today about things that you\\'ve talked about before.\\nBut we\\'re hitting it a little differently, I like to think. DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because what you\\'re talking about\\nis a process. It\\'s verbs. It\\'s all verbs. DAVID GOGGINS: All action. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it\\'s not about success.\\nIt\\'s more, actually, about keeping that friction dialed to 10.\\nAnd no energy drink, no supplement. People often misunderstand me. They think-- like, I\\'m big on people getting sunlight\\nin the morning so they set their circadian rhythm and get better sleep and so they can-- et cetera. But then people always think-- they go straight\\nto the supplements. What should I take? And then, of course, people think I\\'m all about supplements. And supplements are one piece for me.\\nBut it\\'s like tiny fraction compared to the doing, the do\\'s and don\\'ts. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s why I didn\\'t\\nwant to talk about that today. That\\'s why I\\'m glad we\\'re talking about this. This is it. This is it. Like, the brain is the most powerful weapon in the world.\\nAnd it\\'s crazy how a kid that wasn\\'t real smart,\\nI was forced to go only internal. External had to go away.\\nThe external world had to go away. In living so deep inside myself, it was me in this brain\\nand figuring out how this thing works. And so many people are doing exactly that, the supplements,\\nthe this, the that. And I agree, it helps. But once you figure out your brain,\\nyou become unstoppable to almost anything. Yeah, you can\\'t beat death.\\nYou can\\'t whatever, whatever. Your brain is amazing. Once you feed it the right conversation, the right mental\\nnutrients, the right mental supplements, the right internal dialogue at the right time\\nwith the right hit, with the right proof of what you\\'ve done in the past, and you send that right\\nto the right circuit, dude, you\\'re a fucking beast. A beast.\\nBut once again, you just can\\'t read about it.\\nYou can\\'t sit back and be a theorist. You have to be a fucking practitioner.\\nAnd in that practice is where that becomes proof-positive of what I\\'m saying.\\nIt\\'s like, god, David Goggins is blowing my mind. What is this? He\\'s not crazy.\\nAnd so many people, a lot of people,\\nhave listened to me the right way. And they come back, and they\\'re like, I\\'m totally on board.\\nIt happened. It happened. I\\'m like, it\\'ll keep going, man, if you keep doing it.\\nBut that is it, man. There\\'s no sun. There\\'s no glory. There\\'s no carrot.\\nThere\\'s no victory. But there is all of it in one. I just can\\'t explain it real well to people, man.\\nBut what you get the other end is something that you\\'re always found.\\nYou\\'re never lost anymore. Doesn\\'t mean the journey is easy. Doesn\\'t get any easier.\\nBut you\\'re always found. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that. I just want to hover on that for a sec the same way we hovered on haunted and the stick.\\nI think people feel lost. I\\'ve certainly felt lost at times in my life, many times.\\nAnd yeah, there\\'s that thing. I don\\'t think there\\'s a neuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will put it in the comments and say, oh yeah,\\nthat\\'s what so-and-so said. But like you said, we\\'re not trying to be theoretical here. We\\'re trying to be practical. The business of finding yourself and knowing, oh.\\nBut it\\'s sort of like I\\'m safe because I\\'m in danger, and I\\'ve been in danger before, and I got myself out.\\nIt always seems to come back to verbs. Again, I don\\'t have a language for this. For once, I\\'m lost for words.\\nThere\\'s like-- it\\'s about a process, the algorithm. And the reason-- here, I\\'m just kind of trying to make sure\\nI\\'m understanding things correctly. One of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you to be who you are publicly\\nis because people want to focus on the running or the swearing. And by the way, the swearing is welcome.\\nI\\'ll tell you, I came up through laboratories where all three people I worked for swore a lot.\\nBut there was one rule. I couldn\\'t swear at people. So my graduate advisor, brilliant woman,\\nunfortunately, she died early, they all died early-- I\\'m the common denominator. I had that internalized for a long time.\\nAnyway, she said, but if you swear at people, you\\'re out. But you can swear as much as you want. So that\\'s the rule I have.\\nIt\\'s like, you can swear as much as you want. Just don\\'t swear at people. And if you swear at people, better be ready to fight. Definitely not going to fight you.\\nSo you can swear at me, get away with it. But the fact of the matter is that it must be frustrating that people--\\nbecause I know people go, oh, it\\'s all about supplements and ice baths. Listen, I like supplements. I love supplements and ice baths.\\nBut that\\'s not the full picture. It\\'s just a gravitational pull. It\\'s the swearing. It\\'s the running. It\\'s his feet that are all messed up.\\nIt\\'s the fact that he got a Triton. He\\'s a SEAL guy. Talk about that too.\\nAnd there\\'s a gravitational pull for people. And they\\'re missing-- that\\'s the tip of the iceberg,\\nis what I\\'m realizing. I\\'m realizing that today thanks to the way you\\'re phrasing things because the bigger vessel\\nis all in here. And as you said, how do you put that in a book? DAVID GOGGINS: It\\'s impossible. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because it\\'s highly individual.\\nYou do it your way. And you\\'re saying, everyone needs to go figure out how to do it their way for them.\\nYes. And the thing about being misunderstood, it\\'s very frustrating, more than I can even imagine.\\nChallenges & Two Internal Voices, Misunderstood\\nI can\\'t even express how frustrating it is when the cussing and everything comes\\nfrom a place of real. I can\\'t explain what I do without it.\\nThe passion comes out of me. It\\'s almost like speaking in tongues because when you put that much work-- and people go, oh yeah,\\nthere\\'s been this basketball player, this football player, this-- dude.\\nNo. No. Everything, everything is work.\\nEverything. And people don\\'t believe it. So when I speak, the motherfucker and the fuck\\nand the shit, that is what it took for me,\\nwhat it takes for me, the anger, the passion, the jaw-dropping--\\njust it takes that because I\\'m not that.\\nThis is how I look at it, man. What built this guy? Let\\'s imagine being in the coldest\\nwater you can possibly take. I always go back to Hell Week with this. I hated that water.\\nHated it. You\\'re sitting there locked arms, and you\\'re in the water all the time. And they\\'re bringing you in and out of the water,\\nin and out of the water. When you have this dialogue in your head,\\nand these people are judging me off a freaking 1-minute video, and you\\'re constantly your whole life,\\nwhen you figured it out at 24, that I got to-- I just got to, just fucking got to,\\nand this is just going to suck. Every day it\\'s going to suck. And live like that to be better.\\nAnd I put it this way. I\\'m in the water. The water is going over my head, the Pacific Ocean. It\\'s freezing.\\nFebruary. Cold as shit. Been through three Hell Weeks.\\nFor you to constantly win, win, win, when this voice over here, the real you,\\nis saying get the fuck out of here, go, you\\'re nobody.\\nYou\\'ve always been nobody. And it\\'s true. People don\\'t hear that.\\nThat\\'s a true voice. That\\'s a real reality of David Goggins at 24 years old.\\nIt\\'s not a false reality. And then you had to create another voice over here that\\nis saying, you\\'re better than that other voice. And you\\'re in the freezing cold water\\nthat both voices don\\'t want to fucking be in.\\nBut you win. Then goes from the water to the studying\\nto the running to the losing weight to how you eat to how you function as a man. Every day of your life, you\\'re winning these battles.\\nAnd then I have normal people who only have one voice.\\nNever created the second voice. The winning voice is the second voice. They have one voice.\\nAnd that\\'s just, I\\'m a piece of shit. And that\\'s all they hear.\\nAnd then they judge people like me who are out here trying to be better.\\nIt\\'s something that I can never really-- it\\'s a frustrating thing for me because I\\nknow the majority of people. I know what goes on in the brain because I studied the mind\\nmore than almost-- more than you because I\\'m a practitioner.\\nSo for you to be a piece of shit and come out of that, you don\\'t just come out of it.\\nYou spend decades studying your mind and the human mind\\non how it functions in good environments, bad environments, stressful environments, patient environments.\\nYou study it all because you had to put all this together to create the mind to become successful.\\nSo I had to-- it wasn\\'t like God blessed me with this brain. I had to create a mind.\\nAnd so in doing so, I figured out every piece of shit human being in the world because that\\'s what I was going off of for myself.\\nSo I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you-- because you just have the time.\\nYou have the time because you don\\'t want to put that time into bettering oneself.\\nSo I know why I\\'m misunderstood. I\\'m misunderstood by people who have plenty of time\\non their hands to misunderstand me because they are exactly where I once was, which is a low-life, lazy piece of shit.\\nAnd it\\'s the harsh reality of people who troll you, who go after you.\\nThey have nothing better to do with their lives. It\\'s not some after school special.\\nIt\\'s the truth. But I once was that way. I know where it all comes from.\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s frustrating to me now because I\\'m not so frustrated at the fact that I\\'m being trolled. I\\'m frustrated by the fact that you\\ndon\\'t have the courage, the courage to try to be somebody better than what you\\'re not.\\nAnd that\\'s the frustrating part. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\\'s interesting because earlier, we were talking about relationships.\\nRunning, Smoke Jumping; Success; Willpower & Perishable Skills\\nAnd you said, in a very candid way, and I really appreciate you sharing that, that you make sure that the people close\\nto you, your family, has everything they need and that they also understand that you\\'re going to take what you need to continue to build you period.\\nPeriod. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In some ways, it seems you\\'ve also included the general public in that family.\\nYou\\'re saying, listen, I\\'m going to give you what you need. I\\'m going to give you as much of myself as I can,\\nexcept I\\'m going to stop right at the line that if I were to cross it is going\\nto prevent me from continuing to build myself. And by the way, this relationship only exists because I don\\'t cross that line.\\nAnd I think as much as there are detractors out there or people that try--\\nI mean, whatever they\\'re doing is pretty feeble, in my mind. I mean, it\\'s like cap gun fire, it that.\\nVery feeble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us, men and women, old and young,\\nhear something and feel something in your message. Like, yeah, it seems kind of crazy.\\nGosh. Doesn\\'t he ever just relax? What about his sleep? Look at his feet.\\nHe\\'s going to-- he\\'s going to injure himself. Listen, I\\'ll be very direct. I got friends who were in the Teams who just go, what\\'s he\\ngoing to do when he can\\'t run? And I know the answer is keep running. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it\\'s more comfortable\\nfor people, even high achievers-- DAVID GOGGINS: Especially high achievers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to believe that if you\\ntook one thing away, that it would all go away. It\\'s absolutely clear that\\'s not the case with you. I\\'m 100% convinced.\\nI just know that because we\\'re talking about this. DAVID GOGGINS: Do you know how many times I haven\\'t been able to run? Two heart surgeries.\\nMultiple knee surgeries. And after every knee surgery, they said, you\\'re not going to run again. And I\\'m fine with that.\\nThere\\'s no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That\\'s what they lost.\\nWhat if you can\\'t run? Give a fuck. It was never about running.\\nWhy do you think I run? It\\'s the worst thing. I hate doing it more than anything.\\nHence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Your anterior mid-cingulate cortex DAVID GOGGINS: Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --would start to regress\\nif you loved running. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it. Every day, I wake up. I don\\'t just run a mile, two miles.\\nIt\\'s the one thing I hate the most to do. And I do it like I love it.\\n250, 260, 300-mile runs at one time.\\nNo sleep. And every step, when I get to the-- think about this. I get to the fucking start line cussing at Jennifer.\\nWhy the fuck am I here? I hate this shit. After 70-some hours of running, every fucking\\nquestion I ever had is answered. Every question I had is answered. I capped success.\\nPeople go, what do you mean, you capped success?\\nFor me to be who I am-- so when I go smokejump, I smoke jump three to four months out\\nof the year, sometimes five. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you, just for those that aren\\'t educated about-- just\\ngive us a brief description of what smokejumping entails. DAVID GOGGINS: So basically, you jump into fires.\\nNot into them, but you jump by fires that people can\\'t get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out of planes and helicopters.\\nRight, out of planes. I parachute. It\\'s all parachuting. So you parachute out of airplanes.\\nAnd then you fight the fire, you and sometimes four other guys or maybe eight other guys, guys and gals.\\nAnd you\\'re putting this fire out. So I lose millions of dollars every summer to do this.\\nIt blows people\\'s minds. Why the hell are you doing this? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you\\'re breathing soot. DAVID GOGGINS: I\\'m breathing soot. Knees are jacked up.\\nHitting the ground. Hurting. Whatever. Talking to normal people, they\\'ll never get it,\\nso I don\\'t even explain it to them. But this is why-- this is why I call it capped success.\\nI\\'m talking financial success. For me to continue having that willpower, the second I just\\nbecome a speaking monkey and travel around and speaking gigs 12 months out of the year,\\nput camps on, do this, put on lectures, get supplement lines and do this and write more books and shit,\\nI\\'ve ruined the exact thing I worked on my entire life.\\nAnd while I didn\\'t know it until the day, but something always told me, this is a very, very, very perishable skill, this willpower\\nthat you have, because I do have a willpower that I have never seen in anybody in my life. It is a haunting force that just keeps me going.\\nAnd I know that that is my strength. If you have that-- so that\\'s worth every dime I\\'ve ever\\nmade in my life is the fact I can look a man in the eye finally and have a real conversation\\nwithout going like this because I\\'m lying, or I\\'m a piece of shit. Or I know-- you know how a person--\\nand so many people do this shit. They\\'re talking to you on who they want to be.\\nThey\\'re lying to you. And they walk away-- I\\'ve done it so many times. You walk away like, god, man.\\nIf I could just tell them the truth. Why the hell can\\'t I just tell him the truth?\\nKnow how good it feels for me now to look at you in your eye and every man I see because women won\\'t get this.\\nWomen will not get this. Man to man, that man shit, when you look another man in the eye, and you\\nknow that everything you\\'re fucking saying is real, and it comes from a real working place, something\\nthat you earned, it\\'s the best feeling in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can say that actually happened.\\nLike, I know with certainty what I\\'m saying actually happened. DAVID GOGGINS: Actually happened. Who I am and who I say I am, I am.\\nNo more lies. No more skirting the truth. No more bullshit. And that is worth every dime I\\'ve ever made in my life.\\nAnd I swear to God on that. Every dime I\\'ve ever made in my life, building who I built,\\nso I capped success because I know that if I ever go 12 months out of the year\\nand don\\'t put several-- every day, I\\'m going at it. But several months out of the year, I go right back to ground zero, which means\\nI\\'m just fucking David Goggins. No Goggins. No carry boats, fucking logs bullshit.\\nIt\\'s just pick up that fucking Pulaski and dig. Hey, get that fucking pump.\\nWalk down a mile. Put it in the fucking water. Mosquitoes beating-- you\\'re just David Goggins.\\nYou\\'re nobody because that\\'s where my growth is. That\\'s where my willpower comes from.\\nAnd that\\'s where it stays. That\\'s why when I talk to you now-- and can\\'t nobody talk like this, dude.\\nPeople don\\'t talk with this kind of passion because it ain\\'t there. It ain\\'t there. They\\'re regurgitating some shit from 30 fucking years ago.\\nI\\'m regurgitating shit from an hour ago. Hour ago.\\nCome on, man. It\\'s just be real. And I can\\'t be on these podcasts.\\nI can\\'t talk to anybody without being real. I\\'ll go away. I\\'ll just go away because I can\\'t give you\\nwhat I want to give you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You said perishable skill.\\nSelf-Reflection & Action, Distractions\\nI think that\\'s another set of words I want to highlight because skill implies behavior.\\nAnd when we were just talking a second ago about the deep, true bedrock sense of confidence that\\ncomes from looking someone in the eye and telling somebody something that you absolutely know it\\'s true because it happened,\\nyou\\'re talking about actions. Not talking about perceptions. You\\'re not talking about what you believe happened.\\nYou know it happened. And there\\'s something really concrete about actions. I mean, that\\'s what\\'s so interesting is\\nwe\\'re talking about the mind. But actions are the manifestation of the mind.\\nAnd the stuff that just stays in here, people die with that. It doesn\\'t go anywhere.\\nLong ago, somebody said-- I forget what the context was. It was a neuroscientist. He said, most emotions, they\\'re just emotions.\\nThey\\'re just in there. You don\\'t have to do anything with them. And I think certain emotions you want to do something with.\\nBut I think people forget this. They feel miserable, like they\\'re going to dissolve into a puddle of their own tears. No one ever died from an emotion.\\nBut they feel-- they overwhelm us as if it\\'s a tidal wave. It\\'s going to pull us under and drown us.\\nIt\\'s so interesting to me because I think what people-- listen, you have a gravitational pull.\\nPeople can feel the energy. I think, yes, you\\'re either completely badly\\nor partially understood. There\\'s only one guy on the planet that truly understands you. I think there\\'s one woman, Jennifer,\\nwho probably understands you as much as anyone\\'s going to. And then the rest of us are kind of grasping, trying to figure it out.\\nBut you\\'re saying, go inward. So first, go inward.\\nAnd then it\\'s actions. Inward and actions. Now, the inward piece is something I\\'d like to just spend a little bit of time on because there\\nare a couple of characters from history, people that were in concentration camps. Nelson Mandela. I mean, I\\'m not sure he had Instagram in there.\\nI\\'m pretty sure he didn\\'t. And I don\\'t think there was anyone coaching him on, hey, you\\'re going to get out someday.\\nAnd actually, you\\'re going to lead an entire country. I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s not how it worked. He had to find it here.\\nHe had to find it between his ears. And there are other examples. But that\\'s an important one.\\nSo the process of going inward, does it, for you-- and here, I will ask for suggestions\\nbecause I think people want-- there are those of us who want to build this skill.\\nWall yourself off. Phone off for big portions of the day, perhaps.\\nTexting off. The requests, the this, the that.\\nAnyone that knows you knows that-- we\\'ve communicated a few texts, but most of it comes through a filter.\\nShe\\'s great. She knows you. And she knows how to protect your time. DAVID GOGGINS: And that hurts people\\'s feelings.\\nPeople get mad about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hey, God bless-- God bless you, Jennifer.\\nCutting oneself off, when you\\'re in there, you say it\\'s just you.\\nAnd the voices that come up are not pleasant. And then at some point, it converts to action.\\nOK. What is the process of picking the action? That\\'s the piece that I feel like there\\'s,\\nlike, a bridge to build here, if you can, if you would. DAVID GOGGINS: So the action being, like, what\\'s next?\\nYeah, so when you go to sleep at night, when that happens, you know what you\\'re going to do the next day?\\nIt\\'s pre-planned? DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. It\\'s always the same thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You\\'re not building it on the fly.\\nNo. Nothing\\'s on the fly. So how it works internally for me is I\\'ll\\nput it exactly how it is. I\\'m an artist. And every day, I\\'m painting Mona Lisa.\\nEvery day. And but it\\'s a different one. It\\'s not the same painting. So every day I wake up, even though I\\'ll do the same thing,\\nit takes a different way to get there. So every day, in my mind, I\\'m going through my mind. I\\'m just like-- and a good painter will not just paint.\\nHe needs to create. And you can\\'t create with phones and everything going around you.\\nSo you got to block yourself off. You only do two podcasts in a year. You block yourself off.\\nAnd you\\'re painting this thing inside. And you\\'re going through all these different colors of paint and everything else.\\nAnd you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain.\\nSo every single day, I\\'m literally going through my mind, and I\\'m painting. I\\'m creating this masterpiece.\\nAnd the masterpiece is always myself. And but to do that, you cannot have any distractions\\nbecause if you\\'re talking to an artist and he\\'s trying to think about the next painting, he can\\'t.\\nIt\\'s impossible to listen to you and listen to what your mind and body are telling you we must do.\\nBecause people don\\'t do enough of. They don\\'t do any of it. They don\\'t have passion.\\nThey lack passion, drive, determination because you haven\\'t spent time with yourself. Your mind will tell you what is next.\\nBut you haven\\'t spent the time to go, all right, let me just figure this out.\\nYou\\'re looking for let me Google this, and let me Google that, and let me-- you\\'re not going to find it there\\nbecause there\\'s billions of people in this world.\\nAnd they\\'re all supposed to be individuals. But we have a pack mentality.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re so fucking lost. Why am I so unique?\\nI\\'m being exactly what the fuck I was supposed to be. I ain\\'t follow shit. And when I did follow shit, I was like everybody else.\\nThe second I said, OK, man, hang on, dude, you don\\'t like this, you don\\'t like this, you don\\'t like this, who are you,\\nDavid Goggins? Who are you supposed to be? Miraculously, all these things just--\\nI couldn\\'t even-- the list of shit I had to do, just, wham. It\\'s like, fuck.\\nOK. Wow. Once you sit down with yourself and say, OK, I don\\'t want to be like Michael Jordan or Jim Brown--\\nthey\\'re both born on my birthday. So I looked at their birthday. I said, oh, maybe I can be one of the-- I can\\'t.\\nI\\'m going to be David fucking Goggins. And that looks like this.\\nIt just came. Everything flooded. So every single day of my life, there\\'s\\na different thing that comes up that I have to do. But no one knows what to do because everybody else is\\nfollowing steps. Like the Republican and Democratic parties. I\\'m not political--\\nNeither am I. DAVID GOGGINS: --at all for this reason. Republicans are going to vote Republican.\\nDemocrats are going to vote Democrat. You\\'re not even a human fucking being, bro.\\nNo way all you fuckers agree with all the same fucking shit. And I know I don\\'t.\\nSo once you figure out yourself and who you are, all the answers come.\\nSo every night, a different painting is being painted. And it\\'s a beautiful painting for myself.\\nI\\'m like, OK. That\\'s it. It may look the same to most motherfuckers. But the end result is very fucking different.\\nThat\\'s why my-- if you look at what I\\'ve done in 49 years, it\\'s more than most people will ever do in their life\\nbecause they were a race car driver. And that\\'s what they did. They drove a fucking car.\\nIt\\'s great. I was all kind of shit because that\\'s exactly what\\nthe painting was saying to do. It\\'s what the mind was saying to do. Wasn\\'t saying just drive a car, so then that race car driver\\ndidn\\'t know what the fuck to do. He retires from being a race car driver, and they\\'re lost.\\nPeople go, how are you still-- I don\\'t get it. Dude, you\\'re never going to fill your list.\\nBut you never found your list because it never was presented in front of you because your head was\\ncluttered with shit because you never just stopped for lots of minutes, lots of years, and just said,\\nall right, it\\'s me and you. Let it go. And it just-- bam.\\nIt\\'s right there. It\\'s right there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\\'m not a psychologist, as I mentioned before.\\nInner Dialogue; Failing Properly\\nBut I\\'m going to venture a hypothesis here.\\nI think that you\\'ve mastered the process of internal dialogue.\\nBut when I say dialogue, I think most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter.\\nBut that\\'s just one half of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree because I know from experience\\nthat when we go inward, oftentimes, we hear things, if we\\'re really honest with ourselves, it\\'s like, oh no, I don\\'t want to think about that.\\nNo. And then we start looking outward. Or we start trying to shift our attention or distract.\\nAnd there are a million reasons that are handed to us, excuses, and seemingly good justifications\\nto be able to do that. But dialogue is a two-way street. And it hit me while you were just\\nsaying what you were saying, I was paying very close attention. And I realized David Goggins is talking about the voice that\\ncomes up, including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves.\\nBut then he\\'s also got the dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you\\'re right.\\nAnd so I\\'m going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this.\\nYou\\'re in a dialogue, a two-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue.\\nThere are books written by famous psychologists about chatter, trying to shift your internal narrative.\\nYou\\'re like, bring the internal-- the internal narrative, that\\'s what going inward is about. But it\\'s not one voice.\\nAgain, there\\'s a hypothesis. And I\\'m not claiming to be all-knowing. Lord knows I\\'m not all-knowing.\\nBut you\\'ve mastered the dialogue. And if there are three voices, strong, medium, and weak,\\nin there, you\\'re like, let\\'s all come to the table. So you\\'ve got a symphony of voices in there\\nthat are all you, that you know to be you. And you know how to have those convers-- you\\'re not afraid to be in those conversations.\\nAnd then you know what the outcome of that committee decision is, and you put it into real-world action.\\nAnd the world only sees the action. DAVID GOGGINS: That\\'s it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And only you can know your internal dialogue.\\nAnd only I can know my internal dialogue. And the only way to, quote unquote, \"know it\" is to spend a hell a lot of time there.\\nThat\\'s right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. Like, think about it.\\nFor me to be sitting here in front of you, you\\'re not going to call 300-pound Ecolab\\nguy to come sit here. You might. I don\\'t know. Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not. Think about this.\\nWhat we teach people is kind, kindness to yourself.\\nDo you think if I taught myself kindness-- and I agree with it. God, so many people-- so many people take me out of context,\\nit\\'s ridiculous. Take it however the fuck you want to take it. When I was 300 pounds, where do you\\nthink that conversation would that got me if I spoke kindness to myself? I\\'ll tell you where it gets me.\\nRight back to 7-Eleven with another box of mini chocolate donuts and a chocolate milkshake.\\nThat\\'s the one voice. That\\'s the one voice that most of us have\\nthat you\\'re talking about. If you don\\'t have a conversation in there, the other voice that you create that says, OK, how does this look?\\nLooks very ugly. That kind conversation for me went away a long time ago,\\nwhich is why the dialogue is now what you see. A lot of action.\\nBecause most people have inaction because there\\'s one person talking. And that one person is always leading you\\ndown the same path, the path that makes you feel very comfortable and happy with yourself.\\nThe second you create the other voice, there\\'s conflict. Just battles. Just wars.\\nJust defeat. One thing I learned, and I taught myself this, and people go, I don\\'t understand what you\\'re saying,\\nI\\'m going to try to break it down real quick. I didn\\'t teach myself victory first.\\nI taught myself failure. I taught myself how to fail.\\nAnd people like, that\\'s so depressing. Is it? When you\\'re 300 pounds and you can\\'t read and write\\nand you\\'re fucked up, you know how many times you\\'re going to fucking fail on that process? So if you don\\'t know how to fail, there is no victory.\\nI never talked about winning because I knew the path to winning was going\\nto be years of failing first. So I taught myself how to fail properly.\\nNo one teaches you how to fucking fail. But if you\\'re going out for insurmountable fucking\\nodds that make absolutely no fucking sense, a Black kid that can\\'t swim, 300 pounds--\\ngoing to be a Navy SEAL. OK. You better teach yourself how to fail first\\nbecause if you sit in failure for too long, you will never come out of it.\\nSo the first part of my success was learning how to fail properly.\\nAnd then eventually, I started getting a few victories. But that\\'s what people don\\'t get.\\nWhen you have buried yourself in such a deep fucking hole, you better first talk about the failures\\nyou\\'re going to have first. And that\\'s when that other voice comes up. It tells you, we\\'ve got to do something. But it also tells you, boy, I\\'m not\\ngoing to lie to you, Goggins. You\\'re in for a fucking climb, bro. You\\'re going to get your ass handed to you,\\nmade fun of, the outside noise, the inside noise. Both voices are going to be fucking telling\\nyou to go fuck yourself. You are in for hell, bro.\\nI am. So I better learn to fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this is what you mean when you say that whatever anyone says,\\nit\\'s insignificant? DAVID GOGGINS: Insignificant as fuck. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\\'s the cap gun fire because it\\'s just like it-- because the voice\\nin your own head is far worse. And I should say, sorry, one of the voices in your head.\\nI\\'m being very detailed, almost surgical about that because I think this thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice.\\nBut you\\'re making it clear it\\'s many voices. DAVID GOGGINS: It is. And the thing about it is, you have to be really--\\nand sometimes all the voices are telling you the wrong shit, man. But through years, years, not a podcast or listening to a book\\nor reading a book, years of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligent pinpoint fucking work\\non what you want to do for yourself, not like, oh, let me just do a bunch of shit.\\nLet me-- I want to be in every task possible. No.\\nPinpoint what I want to do with my life. What happens is you have all these voices that\\nare telling you you\\'re fucked up, and this is going to be hard. But for some reason, you put so much practice into you\\nthat you can ignore every one of them that are telling you you\\'re not going to fucking make it.\\nAnd still be able to fucking make it because you have put the practice in that you\\nknow this is the process. It\\'s such a daunting task that all the voices are saying no.\\nBut you still have the conviction that I know I can do this. And that\\'s what it took for me to get here.\\n20, 30 years ago, I had this-- 35 or whatever it was, 25 years ago, pipe dream.\\nAnd ever since then, every voice was like, you\\'re a fucking nut.\\nBut when you put that practice in every day, you lace them up. And I mean, run. It\\'s just a metaphor for life.\\nWhen you lace them motherfuckers up every day, pretty soon, you win. Pretty soon, you\\'ll fucking win.\\nIf you have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset of everybody can go fuck themselves,\\nI know what I know. I\\'ve listened to myself enough to know. I know what I know.\\nNone of you can hear what I\\'m hearing. And that\\'s what people don\\'t do enough of. They don\\'t listen to their journey.\\nThey listen to everybody else\\'s shit. Before you know it, I\\'m crazy. But if I\\'m so fucking crazy, why am I so successful?\\nHow that happen? But I\\'m so misguided and fucked up.\\nAnd don\\'t listen to him. Why am I the only one to do a whole bunch of shit?\\nWhy am I a trailblazer? Why? How is that possible? How can you be fucked up and also self-made at the same\\nfucking-- no. No. Obviously, you\\'re not looking at the truth in front of you.\\nThe truth in front of you is it sucks. It\\'s painful. It\\'s fucking mind-numbing.\\nAnd that is the truth. And that\\'s why a lot of people don\\'t like listening to me because this is what it takes,\\ncreating another voice and sometimes going at it alone. All the time going at it alone because no one\\'s\\ngoing to believe in you. And that\\'s that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I\\'m about to say is not conjecture.\\nIntrospection & Unconscious Mind, Cleaning “Cupboards”\\nAnd I can say that with confidence because I did a four-episode guest series with a brilliant psychiatrist, a guy named\\nPaul Conti. He\\'s from Trenton. He\\'s a Stanford, Harvard-trained guy. He\\'s also got a lot of street in him.\\nHe\\'s had his own hardship, real hardship. He\\'s brilliant. And he said something that I\\'ll never forget,\\nwhich is, we think that the forebrain, the part of our brain that creates strategy, et cetera,\\nis the supercomputer. He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. He\\'s like, the supercomputer of the brain\\nis the unconscious mind. It\\'s the part of our mind that\\'s controlling most everything.\\nAnd most people, unfortunately, don\\'t do the work to understand how their unconscious is controlling them.\\nAnd that\\'s a scary thing, this idea, like your mind is controlling you. And I\\'m not going to get into the free will debate.\\nI believe in at least some will. I believe what you\\'re describing and this internal dialogue,\\nI think you have access to your unconscious mind by listening to the dialogue, going inward.\\nWe know this is true in sleep, in dreams, in meditation, and just by shutting out everything else, shutting out\\nall the external noise, which is filled with things that pull us to it. Noise makes it sound bad, but it\\'s the gravitational pull\\nof all the things that allow us to distract ourselves without knowing.\\nThe ice cream. The have a cookie. The Merry Christmas. The unconscious mind, this huge piece\\nof the iceberg underneath that Paul calls the supercomputer, he\\'s saying that with knowledge as a neurobiologist,\\npsychiatrist, psychologist, so he really knows, that\\'s the piece that if one does real introspection,\\nhe calls it the cupboards. You got to look in the cupboards. And it\\'s often really scary what you find in there. And most people are just like, I don\\'t even\\nwant to know the cupboards are there. But you\\'re pulling all the cupboard doors open. And then you\\'re-- and you\\'re extremely deliberate with what\\ngets put into action. You\\'re not just going, oh, like, I\\'m pissed, so I\\'m going to act pissed.\\nOr I\\'m tired, so I\\'m going to act tired. It\\'s you\\'re picking very carefully what to do.\\nAnd that\\'s a process that I\\'m guessing came to you. Does it come to you as a, OK, it makes\\nsense why running makes sense. It makes sense why smokejumping makes sense.\\nSo it seems like a huge portion of your time\\nis spent understanding yourself and making sense to you. And so when people don\\'t understand you,\\nit\\'s got to be extra frustrating because most people don\\'t understand themselves. So then we\\'re all running around going, you\\'re this,\\nand you\\'re that because most people are just unwilling to look inward. And I\\'m including myself, by the way. I mean, I\\'ve done a fair amount of introspection.\\nBut I\\'m inspired today, that word, inspired, but it\\'s true, motivated to start going inward further because it is scary.\\nIt\\'s like, we don\\'t know what\\'s in those cupboards, and it\\'s terrifying, especially because we don\\'t know.\\nAnd those are the first ones to open up. And like you talked about, you got to go through those cupboards. I do spring cleaning every fucking\\nday in those dark cupboards. Those dark cabinets are the ones I start with first.\\nThat\\'s the real me, man. That\\'s the real me. That\\'s why I\\'m not ashamed.\\nI don\\'t hide. I used to hide. I don\\'t hide anymore. He\\'s exactly right. I don\\'t know all the fucking science behind shit.\\nI know what I know. That\\'s why I don\\'t listen to anybody anymore. I don\\'t listen to shit. I think most people are full of shit because I know.\\nI know the deep, dark secrets of those fucking cupboards. It\\'s ugly, man.\\nAnd every day, I\\'m talking to them. Every day, I\\'m cleaning them. I\\'m cleaning them, and I\\'m talking to the same demons that came out of those fucking cupboards\\nas I\\'m cleaning them. Sometimes they go right back in them again. It\\'s not easy.\\nAnd this is why most of us just-- why I am misunderstood because what comes out\\nof those cabinets that I\\'m cleaning, sometimes they see on Instagram.\\nSometimes they\\'ll see it in a podcast. Sometimes they see it in this one. I turn people off. Open up your own cabinets.\\nAnd then go talk about it. Let me see how pretty it looks. Let me see how pretty you sound.\\nLet me see how put together your words are. I bet you a fuck or a motherfucker comes out\\nbecause for you to go back in there again to clean the same fucking cabinet that the demon came out of takes some big balls, bro.\\nTo do it every day of your life. To go back in there and spring clean every day, not once\\na fucking year, once every decade. Every day you know it gets dusty.\\nAnd every day, you don\\'t start with the victories. You don\\'t go, oh, this is nice.\\nLook at my-- look at my I love me wall. Let me clean up. This is a little dusty. No. I go right for the things that are going to keep me buried.\\nAnd I go right there first because if I don\\'t clean those out first, the day doesn\\'t start.\\nSo what are you saying to me is truth. And like I told you many times today, I\\ncan never figure out how to explain this shit to people because I\\'m not neuro nothing.\\nI\\'m just a guy that said, OK, we got to start in the dungeon.\\nAnd we got to stay here for the rest of our lives. For you to become successful, the dungeon\\nis a place that has to be clean. And it\\'s the scariest place to be.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m misunderstood because I\\'m speaking from the dungeon. That\\'s why I am successful because I\\ngo there every damn day. And that is the truth, what he says. It\\'s the exact truth.\\nThose cabinets are fucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit.\\nBroken glass, fucking dark, spiders, cobwebs.\\nBut most of all, your biggest fears, the biggest things that put you in a fucked up place you\\nare today are in there. That\\'s why we all like to keep them shut. You like to lock them up. Act like they never happened.\\nThat\\'s why you never grow. You never improve. You never have real conversations like we\\'re having right now.\\nNever. Never. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Let\\'s not-- no, no, no. Let\\'s not go there.\\nI talked to so many people who tell me that. Let\\'s talk about this.\\nBecause they\\'ll tell me, but they can only say it once. And they\\'ll say it in passing. They won\\'t get deep in the weeds with it.\\nLike, you can\\'t just clean it. Motherfucker, you got to spit shine that motherfucker.\\nYou got to relive it, every fucking detail of it. You can\\'t just be like, oh yeah, yeah, my dad beat me.\\nAnd it is what it is. It ain\\'t is what it is, motherfucker.\\nIt\\'s killing you. It\\'s taken over your whole fucking life. But that\\'s the conversation.\\nYeah, my dad beat-- but I\\'m fine now, though. I\\'m good. OK. All right.\\nNo, you ain\\'t. You ain\\'t fine. You ain\\'t fine. This is real talk. People don\\'t have that.\\nSo your boy\\'s right. 100% right. Scary as shit. It\\'s scary as shit.\\nBut it makes you who you\\'re supposed to be. And that\\'s the test.\\nWe forget. We think we\\'re supposed to breathe air and have kids and pay the bills and shit.\\nBut what\\'s this life about? That makes no sense. We\\'re being tested, my friend.\\nTests come when you have not studied. Tests come when you think that you\\'re in a great place.\\nThat\\'s the test. The test is every day of your life. And most of us fail because we don\\'t know why we\\'re here because we don\\'t go inward to say, oh.\\nYou gave me a lot of shit to fix, man. And this test sucks.\\nBut then you start. ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins.\\nI don\\'t think I could add to that. I know I can\\'t.\\nThank you for sharing what you shared today. I mean, as much as your process or anyone\\'s process\\ncan\\'t be completely understood from the outside,\\nyou gave us a real window into this thing, this process that you--\\nas you said, God put it on you. I believe in God too. People can believe what they want. But somehow, your life, God gave you these challenges early on.\\nAnd then there was a point where you went internal.\\nAnd like you said, you developed a skill. But it\\'s a perishable skill.\\nAnd you clearly live in the process of opening those cupboards, reopening those cupboards,\\ntrying to spit shine those cupboards, understanding that they\\'re never, ever really done,\\nbut that you can gain ground on them, that you can win day after day after day.\\nAnd you really shared a lot of concrete things that I know people are going to be\\nable to apply if they choose. And I agree with you. I think most people will be like, whoa.\\nThat was a lot. It\\'s heavy. I think I want to just kind of bake myself in Netflix and Chex\\nMix instead. But there\\'s also the reality that there\\nare men and women, boys and girls who hear that and go, OK,\\nand start cracking the cupboards open. And I just know that for myself, I\\'m\\nextremely grateful that you\\'re willing to put it all out there. You\\'re so brutally honest, so brutally authentic.\\nThat word authenticity gets thrown around so much. And I can tell you that for me and for everybody else, that\\'s\\nreally what resonates. So whether or not you want to, whether or not it\\'s the purpose behind it or not, you\\'re lighting the path.\\nSo thank you. DAVID GOGGINS: Respect Thank you. Thanks for having me.
